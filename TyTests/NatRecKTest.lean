# One fold for every depth: the node, at depth one, two and three

`FibProposals.md` asked whether **one** constructor can serve `nat_rec`, `nat_rec2`,
`nat_rec3`, … at once, or whether a fixed, finite family is the better answer.  The
answer taken is the first one, and `LeanScript.Term.nat_rec` is now that constructor:

```lean
| nat_rec : ∀ {Γ τ} (k : Nat := 0), Term Sg Γ (.prim .nat) →
    Spine Sg Γ (natRecCtx τ (k + 1) []) →
    Term Sg (TyWf.prim .nat :: natRecCtx τ (k + 1) Γ) τ →
    Term Sg Γ τ
```

Its meaning (`LeanScript.natFoldK`) and the two equations it promises are proved in
`LeanScript.NatRecFacts`, in full generality and at every depth.  What this file checks
is that the generality costs nothing at a *use site*:

1. **Every depth is the one fold.**  The depth-one instance is the old one-step fold
   `LeanScript.natFold` (`natFoldK_eq_natFold`), the depth-two instance is the two-step
   fold of `TyTests/FibWindowTest.lean` (`natFoldK_eq_natFold2`) and computes `fib`, and
   a genuine depth-three recursion — the tribonacci numbers — runs on it.

2. **The types reduce to what one would have written by hand.**  The branch's context at
   a literal depth is the readable `τ :: τ :: Γ` / `τ :: τ :: τ :: Γ` (`natRecCtx_two`,
   `natRecCtx_three`), depth one is the old `nat_rec`'s own type definitionally, the base
   values are an ordinary `Spine`, and the window the evaluator carries **is** the
   environment of that block of the context.

/-! ## The types the node asks for

The worry about a depth-indexed node was that its base values and its branch are typed by
*computed* descriptions, so a written-out term would be full of casts and length proofs.
It is not so, and the checks below are the reason. -/

section Types

variable {Sg : Sig} {Γ : Ctx} {τ : TyWf}

/-- Depth one: the context of the branch is exactly the one-step fold's, so the node
    subsumes it **definitionally** — no term had to be rewritten for the depth. -/
example : Term Sg (TyWf.prim .nat :: natRecCtx τ 1 Γ) τ =
    Term Sg (TyWf.prim .nat :: τ :: Γ) τ := rfl

/-- Depth two: the context a hand-written two-step fold would be written in. -/
theorem natRecCtx_two : natRecCtx τ 2 Γ = τ :: τ :: Γ := rfl

/-- Depth three, and so on: the de Bruijn indices of the branch stay readable. -/
theorem natRecCtx_three : natRecCtx τ 3 Γ = τ :: τ :: τ :: Γ := rfl

/-- The base values are a `Spine` written out as usual — nothing to prove at its type. -/
def baseSpine_two (a b : Term Sg Γ τ) : Spine Sg Γ (natRecCtx τ 2 []) :=
  .cons a (.cons b .nil)

/-- The window the evaluator carries **is** the environment of that block of the
    context. -/
theorem win_eq_denList : NatWin τ 3 = TyWf.DenList (natRecCtx τ 3 []) := rfl

/-- And the environment of the branch is the window in front of the environment of the
    ambient context, with no cast and no length proof. -/
example (w : NatWin τ 2) (env : Env Γ) : Env (natRecCtx τ 2 Γ) := Env.ofWin w env
