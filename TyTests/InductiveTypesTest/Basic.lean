# `deriving LeanScriptTyWf`: the `Ty` of a Lean inductive type

Every `example` below is checked by the kernel, so this file *is* the expectation: what
`LeanScript.tyWfOf α` is for each shape of Lean declaration, and what the handler says about
the declarations it refuses.

Two notes.

* The file deliberately does **not** start with `module`.  An inductive with
  `@[computed_field]`s cannot be declared inside a module-system file (its automatic
  `_impl` machinery lives in a private namespace the module header rejects), and computed
  fields are one of the things this test is about.

* Everything is declared inside `namespace InductiveTypesTest` so that names such as
  `MProd` do not collide with the ones the core library already has.

/-! ## Computed fields are ordinary fields

A `@[computed_field]` is a value the runtime representation *stores*, so it is one more
field of the object: the tree of the declaration is a record holding the shape the
declaration would otherwise have, followed by the terminal types of the cached values, in
declaration order.  When the shape itself is erased — a single-constructor, field-less
declaration — only the cached values are left. -/

example : tyOf Bool = .prim .bool := by rfl

-- A computed field needs at least two constructors (with one constructor there is no tag
-- to store the cached value beside), which is why this is a two-constructor declaration.

/-! ## A model that is a decision, not a translation

`Ordering` is mechanically a field-less sum of three constructors, so a translation would
number them `0`, `1`, `2`.  Its instance says otherwise — the enum is shifted, so that
`lt`, `eq` and `gt` are `-1`, `0` and `1` — and because the answer lives in an instance,
every declaration that mentions an `Ordering` gets *that* model. -/

example : tyOf Ordering = .enum ⟨0, -1⟩ := by rfl

-- The cached values are *part of* a `NatList`, so the tail a `cons` holds is a whole
-- `NatList` — the union together with its sum and length — and not the bare union.  The

-- field of.

-- `Lean.Name` is the recursive tagged union `anonymous | str | num` caching a `UInt64`,
-- so it is the recursive record of that union and the cached value; the `self`s inside
-- the union are occurrences of the record, which is what a `Name` field holds.

/-! ## The same declaration at two different arguments

A list is modelled by its instance, so `List (List Nat)` holds the tree of `List Nat`
**by reference** — the leaf is that instance's own `tyOf`, and the inner list is not
translated, copied or checked again. -/

example : tyOf (List Nat) = .recTaggedUnion (.skip (.here ⟨.prim .nat, [.self]⟩ [])) := by rfl
