# `deriving LeanScriptTyWf`: recursion through a type whose own model is recursive

/-! ## Recursion through a type whose own model is recursive

`inductive RoseList | node : List RoseList → RoseList` and
`structure Rose where kids : Array Rose` describe the same values — a node holds a
sequence of nodes — so both have a model, and the difference is only in *how* the
sequence is written.

* `Array`'s model is a shape, so the occurrence can stand inside it directly:
  `Rose = μX. Array X`.
* `List`'s model is a binder of its own (`nil | cons α self`), so an occurrence placed
  inside it would read as an occurrence of the *list*.  The binder is therefore hoisted
  into a member of a mutual family — the nested recursion becomes a mutual one, which is
  what Lean itself does with a nested inductive:

  ```text
  member 0 = RoseList = member 1
  member 1 = nil | cons (_ : member 0) (_ : member 1)
  ```
-/

/-- `Rose` (declared above) holds its children in an `Array`, whose model is a shape, so
    the occurrence stands inside it and no family is needed. -/

inductive RoseList where
  | node : List RoseList → RoseList
  deriving LeanScriptTyWf

/-- `RoseList` is modelled by the family its nested recursion unfolds to: member `0` is
    the declaration, member `1` is the list of them. -/

    tyOf RoseList
      = .mutualRecursiveFamily

-- A wrapper inside a wrapper adds one member per binder on the path to the occurrence.

-- The declaration keeps its own shape: here a sum with a base case, whose recursive
-- constructor holds the list.

-- A parameter is no obstacle: the list is of the declaration at *its own* arguments.

-- one binder into one member, and there is no member a whole family can become.

error: the type `InductiveTypesTest.ViaFamily` has no `Ty`: `ListA
  ViaFamily` mentions the declaration being defined through a type this handler cannot recurse through: the occurrence goes where the argument's tree would stand in the type former's own model (`Array`, `Thunk`, `Option`, `×`, `⊕`, a function type, any non-recursive wrapper), and a binder that would capture it there is hoisted into a member of a family (`List`, any recursive wrapper) — but the model of this one is a mutual family, or does not hold the argument as one tree
