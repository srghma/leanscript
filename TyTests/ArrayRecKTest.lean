# One fold of an array for every lookback depth

`TyTests/NatRecKTest.lean` checks that **one** constructor serves `nat_rec`, `nat_rec2`,
`nat_rec3`, … at once.  This file is the same check for the fold of an *array*, which now
carries the same depth:

```lean
| array_rec : ∀ {Γ σ τ} (k : Nat := 0), Term Sg Γ (.array σ) →
    ArrayRecBases Sg Γ σ τ k →
    Term Sg (σ :: TyWf.array σ :: natRecCtx τ (k + 1) Γ) τ → Term Sg Γ τ
```

A recursion over a list that reads the answer at more than the immediate tail — the
analogue of `fib`'s `n + 2` pattern — is exactly what a depth needs to be added for:

```lean
def cont : List Nat → Nat
  | [] => 1
  | [a] => a
  | a :: b :: as => a * cont (b :: as) + cont as
```

That is the **continuant**: the numerator of the continued fraction
`a₀ + 1/(a₁ + 1/(a₂ + …))`, and the array-valued `fib` — on a list of `n` ones it is
`fib (n + 1)`, which `TyTests/ArrayRecDepthTest.lean` proves.  It reads the answer at
`as`, which is the tail of the tail, so no one-element fold writes it.

What is checked here, at the level of the meaning (`LeanScript.listFoldK`):

1. **Every depth is the one fold.**  Depth zero **is** the old one-element fold
   `LeanScript.listFold` (`LeanScript.listFoldK_eq_listFold`), depth one computes the
   continuant, and a genuine depth-two recursion — the continuant that looks back three
   suffixes — runs on it.

2. **The types reduce to what one would have written by hand.**  The branch's context at
   a literal depth is the readable `σ :: array σ :: τ :: τ :: Γ`, depth zero is the old
   `array_rec`'s own type definitionally, and the window the evaluator carries **is** the
   environment of that block of the context.
