# The `fib` suite, over a mutual recursive family: `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec` at every depth

`TyTests/NatRecDepthTest.lean` writes the family of Fibonacci programs — the `n + 2`
recursion, the tail-recursive loop, the pair recursion, and the tribonacci … hexanacci
numbers — as terms that fold over a `Nat`; `TyTests/ArrayRecDepthTest.lean`,
`TyTests/RecUnionRecDepthTest.lean`, `TyTests/RecObjectRecDepthTest.lean` and
`TyTests/RecAliasRecDepthTest.lean` do the same for a fold over an array, over a recursive
tagged union, over a recursive record and over a recursive newtype.  This file is that
exercise for a fold over a **mutual recursive family**, which is
`LeanScript.Term.mutualRecursiveFamily_rec`.

The family is a `mutual` block of two declarations — the Peano naturals and a list of
naturals:

```lean
mutual
inductive Pe where
  | zero
  | succ (n : Pe)
inductive Ls where
  | nil
  | cons (a : Nat) (as : Ls)
end
```

so `fib` is the program the depth is for:

```lean
def Pe.fib : Pe → Nat
  | .zero            => 0
  | .succ .zero      => 1
  | .succ (.succ n)  => fib n + fib (.succ n)
```

Its `succ` branch does not answer: it **looks one constructor further down**, and only
then answers, using the value of the recursion at the value it descended past *and* at the
one it arrived at.  That is exactly the shape of a depth-one branch of the fold —
`LeanScript.FamilyFoldKBranch.deep`, which names the field descended into, says which
member of the family that field is an occurrence of, and dispatches on **that member**
again — and the nesting of the Lean `match` above is the nesting of the case tree below,
one for one.

| the program | the node it is | here |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Pe.fib` (reads two constructors down) | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 1` | `fibTerm` |
| `Pe.trib`, `Pe.tetra`, `Pe.penta`, `Pe.hexa` | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 2 … 5` | `tribTerm`, `tetraTerm`, `pentaTerm`, `hexaTerm` |
| `Pe.fibLoopTR` (tail-recursive, two accumulators) | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0` **at a function type** | `fibTRTerm` |
| `Pe.fibPair` (pair recursion) | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0` at a record type | `fibPairTerm` |
| `Ls.cont` (the continuant, over the **other member**) | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 1`, descending into the *second* field | `contTerm` |
| `Ev.fib` (over a family whose members mention **each other**) | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 1`, descending into the *other member* | `TyTests/FamilyRecDepthMembersTest.lean` |
| `Node.fib` (over a family of a record, a union and a newtype) | `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 1`, both recursive members descending | `TyTests/FamilyRecDepthMembersTest.lean` |
| `fibFast` (halves its argument) | no depth reaches it | the prose at the end |

A fold over a family always gives the branches of **every** member, whichever member the
value belongs to and wherever a deeper look lands, so each term below carries the branches
of both members of its family; §1 says what those branches bind.

**What is checked.**  `LeanScript.Ty.Den` gives a recursive shape no values — there is no
least fixpoint in the model yet — so, exactly as in `TyTests/RecTermTest.lean`, a term over
a family is checked **by its type** rather than by running it: each definition below states
the type of the term it builds, so the file fails to build if the branch a program needs
cannot be written at that depth, or is written in a context other than the documented one.
What the contexts are is pinned separately, by the `rfl` examples of §1, and the Lean
programs at the top of each section say what each term means.

Those Lean programs are themselves checked, in §0: their values at `10` by `#guard`, that
`Pe.fib` is the ordinary `fib` at *every* argument (`Pe.fib_ofNat`), and the three theorems
of the request — `Pe.fibPair_eq`, `Pe.fibPair_fst_eq_fib` and `Pe.fibTR_eq_fib`, that the
pair recursion and the tail-recursive loop both compute `fib`.

The depth-zero fold is the fold that was there before the depth was added: §8 checks that,
at `k = 0`, no branch can look down at all, and `LeanScript.FamilyRecFacts` proves that the
branches of a depth-zero fold are exactly the branches of the plain fold.

What a deeper look into **another member** looks like, and what the branches of a record
member and of a newtype member are, is the companion file
`TyTests/FamilyRecDepthMembersTest.lean`.

The terms are **written out**: `#leanscript_to_term` compiles a recursion on a `Nat` at any
depth, and a recursion on a list one constructor at a time, so a depth-`k` recursion over a
mutual family is not something it reads yet.

constructors `zero`, which carries nothing, and `succ`, whose one field is an occurrence of
member `0`; member `1` has `nil`, which carries nothing, and `cons`, which carries a
natural and an occurrence of member `1`.  A family is written in the scope of all of its
members, so a field is `Ty.familyMember i` rather than `Ty.self`. -/
