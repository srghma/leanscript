# The recursive shapes of the grammar, written out

`Ty` has four recursive binders, and `LeanScript.Term` has an introduction form, a case
analysis and a fold for each of them, plus a partial case analysis with a default where
the shape has constructors to leave out.  Each example below builds a term of a stated
type, so the file fails to build if one of those constructors cannot be applied as its
documentation says.

The examples also pin the two things that make the recursive forms usable without writing
anything by hand: the **unfolding** of a payload reduces (`Ty.recTaggedUnionUnfold` of a
concrete schema is a concrete schema, so a field written `Ty.self` really does take a
value of the recursive type), and the tag's bound is written by `ctor_tag`.

/-! ## An introduction form builds a value of a **type**

`Ty` is a tree, and not every tree is a type: a binder may fail to mention itself, may
mention itself in the domain of a function — `μX. X ⇒ Nat`, at which a term language
diverges — or may describe an equation no value satisfies, like `μX. Nat × X`.  The four
recursive introduction forms therefore carry `LeanScript.Ty.Wf` of the tree they build a
value of, written by `ty_wf`, so none of those trees has a value in the grammar.  The
eliminators do not carry it, and they do not have to: a `Term` is indexed by a **type**,
so a tree that is not one has no term of it to take apart in the first place.  The two
examples below are the two ways a binder fails to be a type, and each of them is now
refused where the type is written rather than where a value of it is. -/

-- `cellTy`, above, is the equation `T = Nat × T`: refused at the type.

-- A union that mentions itself in the **domain** of a function would be `μX. (X ⇒ Nat)`.
-- It is inhabited — its first constructor has no fields — but it is not positive, and
-- here it is refused one step earlier still: `Ty.self ⇒ Ty.prim .nat` is not even a
-- well-formed *payload*, since the domain of a function is checked in the closed scope,
-- so the schema of such a union cannot be written.

/-! ## What the evaluator says about them

`LeanScript.Ty.Den` gives a recursive shape no values, so `LeanScript.Term.eval` is the
evaluator of a model **without recursive data**: it interprets every term that does not
*build* one of these values — taking one apart included, since there is nothing to take
apart — and `LeanScript.Term.run` asks for that by its `Term.NoRecMk` hypothesis. -/

example : Term.NoRecMk natHead := by no_rec_mk
example : Term.NoRecMk natFoldZero := by no_rec_mk

-- Building a recursive value is outside the model, and the hypothesis says so rather
-- than the evaluator pretending to have a value for it.
