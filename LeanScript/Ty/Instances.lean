# The instances the language comes with

The Lean types the language knows about have their model written here, once: the terminal
types, the type formers it has a shape for (`Array`, `Thunk`, `→`), and the handful of
library types whose model is a *decision* rather than a mechanical translation.

Everything else gets its instance from `deriving LeanScriptTyWf`
(`LeanScript.Ty.Deriving`), which builds a type's tree out of the trees of these.

## Why some of these are written by hand

`Ordering` is the example.  Mechanically it is a field-less sum of three constructors, so
a translation would give it `Ty.enum ⟨0, 0⟩` — the constructors numbered `0`, `1`, `2`.
What it should be is the enum numbered from `-1`, so that `lt`, `eq` and `gt` are `-1`,
`0` and `1` and comparison is a subtraction.  Because the answer lives in an instance,
that decision is made **once** and everything that mentions an `Ordering` — every record
with an `Ordering` field, in any module — uses it; there is no second model of `Ordering`
anywhere, and nothing has to know that the model is unusual.

/-! ## Library types

Each of these is the tree `deriving LeanScriptTyWf` would give it, written out here because
the declaration belongs to the core library and cannot carry a `deriving` clause — except
`Ordering`, whose model is a decision (see the header).

The trees are stated once, as type formers of the language (`TyWf.option`, `TyWf.prod`,
`TyWf.sum`, `TyWf.list`, `TyWf.ordering`), and the instances are these formers applied to
the models of the arguments.  Everything else that needs the model of one of these types —
the externs of `Init` (`LeanScript.Expr.Extern`), the reading back of a list value
(`LeanScript.Den.Rec`), `#leanscript_to_term` — uses the same formers, so there is one
model of each. -/
