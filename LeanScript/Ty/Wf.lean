# `Ty.Wf`: the proposition that a tree is a type

A `LeanScript.Ty` is a plain tree: nothing stops a tree from using `Ty.self` where no
declaration is being defined, or from naming member `7` of a family of two, or from
calling itself recursive while mentioning itself nowhere.  Those conditions are stated
here, as **inductive propositions** about a tree, and a `LeanScript.LeanScriptTyWf` instance
carries a proof of them beside its tree.

They are propositions rather than a Boolean check (`wf t = true`) for one reason: a proof
is *composed*.  `LeanScriptTyWf (Option α)` builds its tree out of the tree of `α` and its
proof out of the proof of `α`, without ever looking inside either — so a type that has
been checked is not checked again at any of its use sites, in this module or in a later
one.  See `LeanScript.Ty.WfTactic` for the tactic that composes them.

## The scope index

`Ty.WfIn n t` reads: `t` is well formed **in a scope of `n` members**.

| `n` | where | which occurrences are legal |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `0` | a closed type | none |
| `1` | inside a binder that recurses on its own | `Ty.self` |
| `n ≥ 2` | inside a family of `n` members | `Ty.familyMember i` for `i < n` |

`Ty.Wf t` is `Ty.WfIn 0 t`: the tree of a real, closed type.  A closed tree is well formed
in every scope (`Ty.WfIn.closed`), which is what lets a checked type be dropped into the
payload of a new declaration for nothing.

## What is checked

* **Scope.** Every occurrence names a member the scope has.
* **Recursion.** Every recursive binder is really recursive — its payload mentions it —
  and every member of a family is mentioned by the family.
* **Positivity.** An occurrence never stands in the *domain* of a function type: the
  domain of `Ty.fn` is checked in the closed scope (`Ty.WfShapeIn.fn`), so `μX. X → Nat`,
  at which a term language diverges, is not a type.
* **Inhabitation.** Every binder describes a type that has *values*: its payload is
  inhabited without assuming that the declaration being defined is (`Ty.HabIn`), and in a
  family every member becomes inhabited in some order (`Ty.FamHab`).  So `μX. X` — the
  equation `T = T`, which no value satisfies — is not a type, while `μX. Array X` is (the
  empty array), and neither is `inductive Bad | mk : Bad → Bad`, which Lean does accept
  and which therefore has to be refused here rather than at the front end.

Inhabitation is a *least fixpoint*: `μX. F X` has a value exactly when `F ∅` does, because
`F` is monotone — which is why the payload of a binder is checked with nothing assumed
(`Ty.HabIn … []`), and why positivity has to be checked for the monotonicity to hold.  A
family needs the iteration, and `Ty.FamKnown` performs it: it grows the set of members
already known to have values, one member at a time.

/-! ## Where a declaration is mentioned -/

mutual

/-- `Ty.OccursIn i t`: the tree `t` contains an occurrence of member `i` of the scope it
    is written in.  A nested binder is *not* looked into: the occurrences inside it belong
    to its own scope. -/
inductive OccursIn : Nat → Ty → Prop where
  /-- `Ty.self` is an occurrence of member `0` — the only member a lone binder has. -/
  | self : OccursIn 0 .self
  /-- `Ty.familyMember i` is an occurrence of member `i`. -/
  | familyMember {i : Nat} : OccursIn i (.familyMember i)
  /-- A shape mentions a member when one of its children does. -/
  | shape {i : Nat} {s : TyShape Ty} : OccursSomeIn i s.children → OccursIn i (.shape s)

/-- `Ty.OccursSomeIn i ts`: one of the trees `ts` mentions member `i`. -/
inductive OccursSomeIn : Nat → List Ty → Prop where
  /-- The first of them does. -/
  | head {i : Nat} {t : Ty} {ts : List Ty} : OccursIn i t → OccursSomeIn i (t :: ts)
  /-- A later one does. -/

end

/-- `Ty.MembersOccur k ts`: each of the members `0, …, k-1` is mentioned somewhere in the
    trees `ts`.  This is what makes a family a family rather than a `mutual` block of
    declarations that happen to be written together. -/
inductive MembersOccur : Nat → List Ty → Prop where
  /-- No member has to be mentioned. -/
  | zero {ts : List Ty} : MembersOccur 0 ts
  /-- Members below `k` are mentioned, and so is member `k`. -/

      MembersOccur k ts → OccursSomeIn k ts → MembersOccur (k + 1) ts

/-! ## Inhabitation: a type that has values

`Ty.HabIn S t` reads: the tree `t` describes a type that **has a value**, given that
member `i` of the scope `t` is written in has one for each `i ∈ S`.

The list `S` is what makes this a least fixpoint rather than a circular argument.  A
binder is checked with `S = []` — nothing about the declaration being defined is assumed,
which is exactly "`F ∅` has a value" — and a family grows `S` one member at a time
(`Ty.FamKnown`), so `A = B`, `B = Nat` is accepted in two rounds and `A = B`, `B = A` is
not accepted at all.

What has a value at each shape: a terminal type and an enum always; an array always, since
the empty array is one; a thunk or a lazy value when what it delays has one; a function
when its *result* has one (the constant function), whatever its domain; a record when all
of its fields have one; a sum when *some* constructor's fields all have one. -/

new declaration's inhabitation condition has to be discharged for it.  `Ty.HabIn.of_wf`
is what discharges it: a closed type has values, so nothing about it is looked at a second
time.  This is the inhabitation counterpart of `Ty.WfIn.closed`, and it is a theorem
rather than a rule so that `Ty.HabIn` is a definition in its own right. -/
