# Unfolding a binder keeps every field a type

The payload of a recursive binder is written in the scope that binder opens, so a field of
it — `Ty.self`, or a tree that mentions it — is **not** a type of the language on its own.
What a value of that field is is the field *unfolded*: `Ty.self` replaced by the binder
itself (`LeanScript.Ty.unfoldSelf`).

This module is the proof that unfolding gives types: substituting a **closed** type for the
occurrences of a tree that is well formed in the scope of one binder gives a tree that is
well formed in the closed scope (`Ty.wf_substOcc`).  It is what lets the introduction and
elimination forms of a recursive shape state their fields as types of the language — a
`LeanScript.TyWf` each — rather than as bare trees with a side condition.

The proof is one induction over the three mutually inductive families of
`LeanScript.Ty.Wf`, with one motive each.  Two cases carry it:

* the **domain of a function** is checked in the closed scope already, so the induction
  hypothesis for it is the conclusion;
* a **nested binder** is left alone by the substitution, and its rule proves it well formed
  in *every* scope, so there is nothing to substitute and nothing to prove.

/-! ## Substitution -/

/-- **A closed type put in for the occurrences of a tree keeps it a type.**  `t` is well
    formed in the scope of one binder — so its only occurrence leaf is `Ty.self` — and `S`
    is a closed type, so `t` with `S` for `Ty.self` is a closed type.

    A tree that is closed already (`n = 0`) is a special case: the substitution does not
    change it, and the statement says it is still a type. -/

family, with that member selected.  Selecting a member changes nothing a family's

so every member of a family that is a type is a type, which is what unfolding the scope of
a family needs. -/
