declaration's type into its tree.

/-! ## Hoisting a recursive wrapper into a member of a family

A field of type `List T`, where `T` is the declaration being defined, cannot be modelled
by `List`'s tree with the occurrence in the place of the argument: the occurrence would
land inside `List`'s *own* binder and would denote the list.  But the declaration is
still a type of the language, because a nested recursion is a mutual one — which is what
Lean itself does with a nested inductive.  `inductive RoseList | node : List RoseList →
RoseList` is the family

```text
member 0 = RoseList = member 1                 -- the declaration
member 1 = nil | cons (_ : member 0) (_ : member 1)   -- the list of them
```

So the binder that would have captured the occurrence is *hoisted*: it becomes one more
member of the family the declaration is translated in, its own `Ty.self` becomes an
occurrence of that member, and the occurrence it holds becomes an occurrence of the
declaration.  Nothing about the wrapper is re-read from Lean — the tree that is taken
apart is the wrapper's own model, from its instance — and a wrapper nested in a wrapper
(`List (List T)`) adds one member per binder on the path to the occurrence.

When the declaration is alone in its block it becomes member `0` of the new family, so
every `Ty.self` in the trees of its own fields becomes `Ty.familyMember 0`; that is
`selfToMember`. -/
