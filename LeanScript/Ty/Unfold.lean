# Unfolding a recursive type one level

`Ty` has four **binders** — `Ty.recTaggedUnion`, `Ty.recObject`, `Ty.recAlias` and
`Ty.mutualRecursiveFamily` — and two **occurrence leaves** — `Ty.self`, which is the
declaration a lone binder defines, and `Ty.familyMember i`, which is member `i` of the
family a `Ty.mutualRecursiveFamily` defines.  The payload of a binder is written in the
scope the binder opens, so it is *not* a list of types of the language on its own: the
type of a field of a list of naturals is `Ty.self`, and what a value of that field really
is is a list of naturals again.

**Unfolding** is what turns a payload written in a scope into types of the language:
substituting each occurrence leaf by the type it stands for.  It is what an introduction
form and an eliminator of a recursive shape need — `LeanScript.Term.recTaggedUnion_mk`
takes the fields of a constructor *unfolded*, and `LeanScript.Term.recTaggedUnion_casesOn`
branches on the *unfolded* schema — and this module is that substitution.

## A nested binder is not looked into

`LeanScript.Ty.WfIn` checks the payload of a binder in the scope that binder opens, and
checks a *nested* binder's payload in the scope the nested binder opens: an occurrence
inside a nested binder belongs to the nested binder.  So substitution stops at a binder,
exactly as `LeanScript.Ty.OccursIn` does.

## Why the traversal is written out

`Ty` is a nested inductive — its children sit inside `TyShape`, `LeanRecordSchema`,
`LeanTaggedUnionSchema` and `NonEmptyList` — so a traversal written as `s.map subst` is
not structurally recursive as far as Lean is concerned.  As in `LeanScript.Ty.beq`, the
traversal is therefore one function per container, all in one `mutual` block, and
`Ty.substOcc_shape_eq_map` and friends record that the block does agree with the `map`
of each container, which is how the *top-level* unfoldings below are stated.

/-! ## The two scopes

A lone binder has one thing in scope, the declaration itself, so its unfolding only has
to say what `Ty.self` is; a family has one thing in scope per member, so its unfolding
only has to say what each `Ty.familyMember i` is. -/

/-- The tree `t`, written in the scope of a lone binder, read as a type of the language:
    `Ty.self` is the binder `r` itself. -/
def unfoldSelf (r : Ty) (t : Ty) : Ty := substOcc r .familyMember t

/-- The tree `t`, written in the scope of a mutual family, read as a type of the
    language: `Ty.familyMember i` is the type `mem i`. -/
def unfoldMembers (mem : Nat → Ty) (t : Ty) : Ty := substOcc .self mem t

    a member of it, which `LeanScript.Ty.WfIn` rules out. -/

/-! ## The unfolding of each recursive shape

Each of the four is the payload of the binder with the binder's own occurrences
substituted away, so the result describes exactly what a *value* of the shape holds. -/

/-- The constructors of a recursive tagged union, unfolded: the field types of a value of
    `Ty.recTaggedUnion l`, constructor by constructor.  The schema has the same shape as
    `l` — the same constructors, in the same order, with the same number of fields — so
    the branches of a dispatch on it are the branches of a dispatch on `l`. -/

    family. -/

    LeanRecordSchema Ty :=
  fs.map (unfoldFamily f)

/-! ## What a branch of a fold binds

A `_casesOn` binds the fields of the constructor it matched; a `_rec` binds those *and*
the value of the fold at each field that is an occurrence of the type being folded over.
The value is **given** to the branch rather than computed by it, which is what keeps a
term terminating by construction.

Only a field that is *literally* an occurrence — `Ty.self`, or `Ty.familyMember i` —
comes with the value of the fold.  A field that mentions the type only *inside* another
former (an array of it, say) is bound as it is: the fold of the elements of an array of
the type is a map, not a binding, and the grammar does not have one. -/

/-- The binders a branch of `LeanScript.Term.recTaggedUnion_rec` gets, for a constructor
    whose field types are `fs`: every field, unfolded, and — right after a field that is
    an occurrence of the type `r` being folded over — the value of the fold at that
    field, of the type `motive` the fold answers.

    A recursive **record** and a recursive **newtype** are folded differently: no field of
    a record, and no body of a newtype, is literally an occurrence of it, so this gives
    their branches nothing (`LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders_recObject`,
    `LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders_recAlias`); `LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec` binds
    `LeanScript.TyWf.recObjectRecBinders` and `LeanScript.Term.recAlias_rec` binds
    `LeanScript.TyWf.recAliasRecBinders` instead. -/
