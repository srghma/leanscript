# `ty_wf`: reading the goal, and the leaves it does not walk into

Small readers of lists and numerals, and the recognition of a subtree that is already
answered for: the tree of a bundled `LeanScript.TyWf`, or a local variable with a
hypothesis.

/-! ### The bundled tree, named rather than imported

`LeanScript.TyWf` — a tree together with the proof that it is one — is declared *after*
this module, because the proof it carries is written `by ty_wf`.  So the two projections
it is recognised by are named here as plain `Name`s rather than resolved at compile time;
they are in the environment by the time the tactic runs, which is every module from
`LeanScript.Ty.TyWf` on. -/

/-- The structure of a tree together with its proof, `LeanScript.TyWf`. -/
def tyWfStruct : Name := `LeanScript.TyWf
/-- Its tree, `LeanScript.TyWf.toTy`. -/
def tyWfToTy : Name := `LeanScript.TyWf.toTy
/-- Its proof, `LeanScript.TyWf.isWf`. -/
def tyWfIsWf : Name := `LeanScript.TyWf.isWf

/-- Is `t` the tree of a bundled `LeanScript.TyWf` — the tree of an instance, say?  If so,
    the proof that it is a type, which is that bundle's own field — no tree is
    traversed. -/
def instanceWf? (t : Expr) : MetaM (Option Expr) := do
  let bundle? : Option Expr :=
    match t with
    | .proj s 0 b => if s == tyWfStruct then some b else none

      | _, _ => none
  let some bundle := bundle? | return none
  return some (mkApp (mkConst tyWfIsWf) bundle)

/-- Is there a hypothesis saying that `t` is a type?  This is what closes the parameters
    of a generated tree, which stand for the trees of the type's own parameters. -/

        if x == t && (← natOf? n) == some 0 then return some d.toExpr
    | _ => pure ()
  return none

/-- Is the head of `t` a constructor of `LeanScript.Ty`? -/
def isTyCtor (t : Expr) : Bool :=

  | _ => false

/-- Expose what a tree is at its root, **without** unfolding past a leaf that some
    instance or some hypothesis already answers for.  Ordinary `whnf` would unfold such a
    leaf into the tree behind it, which is exactly the copying this class exists to
    avoid, so the definition at the head is unfolded one step at a time and the leaf is
    looked for before each step. -/
partial def tyHeadNorm (t : Expr) : MetaM Expr := do
  let t ← whnfCore t
  if isTyCtor t then return t
  if (← instanceWf? t).isSome then return t
