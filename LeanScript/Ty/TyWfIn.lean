# Types of the language written inside a binder, bundled

`LeanScript.TyWf` — a tree together with the proof that it is a type of the language — and
the constructors that need nothing but closed types (`TyWf.prim`, `TyWf.fn`, `TyWf.array`,
`TyWf.record`, …) are in `LeanScript.Ty.TyWf`.  This module adds what a *binder* needs:
`LeanScript.TyWfIn`, the same bundle for a tree written **inside a binder**, and the
constructors of the recursive shapes, which take their payload in that form.

## Why there are two

The payload of a recursive binder is written in the scope that binder opens, so a field of
it is not a closed type: `Ty.self` is a field of the schema of `List α`, and it is a type
only once the binder is put back in for it.  `TyWfIn n` is a tree that is well formed *in a
scope of `n` members*, and `TyWfIn.unfold` is the step from one to the other: a field of a
binder's payload (`TyWfIn 1`) becomes a type (`TyWf`) once the binder itself is substituted
for its occurrences, which is `LeanScript.Ty.wf_unfoldSelf`.

So a schema of the language is a schema **of bundles**: `LeanRecordSchema TyWf` for a
record, `LeanTaggedUnionSchema (TyWfIn 1)` for the payload of a recursive union.  The tree
of such a schema is its `map` to trees, and the proof of the whole is composed from the
fields' — there is no list of trees with a side condition anywhere, and no proof carried
inside a list.

    of a binder is written in `TyWfIn 1`, where `Ty.self` is legal, and a closed type is

    The proof is written by `ty_wf` unless one is given. -/

/-! ## The recursive shapes

A binder is built from a payload written in the scope it opens — a schema of `TyWfIn 1` —
and the conditions that make it a *type*: that it mentions itself, only positively, and has
values.  Those are not consequences of the payload being well formed, so they stay a proof
argument, written by `ty_wf` unless one is given. -/

/-! ## Unfolding a binder

The fields of a value of a binder are the fields of its payload with the binder put back in
for its occurrences.  At the level of bundles that is the `map` of `TyWfIn.unfold`, so it
needs nothing beyond the schema and the binder itself. -/

/-! ## A mutual recursive family

A family has **at least two** members, so the scope its payload is written in is written
`n + 2` rather than `n`: that is what makes a member of it never a `Ty.self`, and it is
what `LeanScript.Ty.wf_substOccFam` needs in order to read a member as a type.  The
conditions that make the family a family — that every member is mentioned, positively,
and has values — are not consequences of the members being well formed in that scope, so
they stay a proof argument, written by `ty_wf` unless one is given. -/

/-! ## What a branch of a fold binds

A branch of a fold binds every field of its constructor, unfolded, and — right after a
field that is *literally* an occurrence of the type being folded over — the value of the
fold at that field.  These are `LeanScript.Ty.recBinders` and
`LeanScript.Ty.famRecBinders` at the level of bundles. -/

/-- The binders of a branch of a fold over a lone binder: every field, unfolded, with the
    value of the fold after each field that is an occurrence of the binder. -/
def recBinders (r motive : TyWf) : List (TyWfIn 1) → List TyWf
  | [] => []
  | ⟨.self, _⟩ :: fs => r :: motive :: recBinders r motive fs
  | a :: fs => TyWfIn.unfold r a :: recBinders r motive fs

/-! ## What a branch of a fold of a recursive **record** binds

A recursive record is the one binder whose fields can never be an occurrence of it
*literally*: a record has values only when **all** of its fields do, so a field written
`Ty.self` would make the record the equation `T = … × T × …`, which no value satisfies
(`LeanScript.Ty.not_wf_recObject_self`).  Its occurrences of itself therefore always sit
**inside** another former — `Array T`, or a union with a constructor that does not mention
it — and `TyWf.recBinders` hands such a field over as it is, with no value of the fold
beside it (`LeanScript.RecObjectRecFacts.recBinders_recObject`).

So the answers of a fold of a record are given in the **shape of the record's own
fields**: `TyWf.recObjectMap fs X` is the record with every occurrence of the record
replaced by `X`, which for `T = { n : Nat, kids : Array T }` and `X = τ` is
`{ n : Nat, kids : Array τ }` — each subvalue replaced by the value of the fold at it.

That is the whole of a depth-zero fold.  A **depth-`k`** one replaces each subvalue not by
its answer alone but by its `TyWf.recObjectAnswerTree` of depth `k`: the answer at it,
together — in the shape of *its* fields — with the answer trees of depth `k - 1` of its
own subvalues.  So a branch reads the answers at everything `k + 1` levels down, along
the path it descends, exactly as a depth-`k` branch of `Term.recTaggedUnion_rec` does and
as `Term.nat_rec` at depth `k` reads the answers at `n - 1, …, n - 1 - k`. -/

/-- The fields of a recursive record with every occurrence of the record itself replaced

  .record (fs.map (TyWfIn.unfold X))

/-- **The answers at a subvalue of a recursive record and at everything `j` levels below
    it**: at `j = 0` the answer at the subvalue alone, and at `j + 1` that answer paired

    the record's fields. -/

/-- The binders of the branch of a depth-`k` fold of a recursive record: every field of

    immediate subvalues. -/

    (hwf : Ty.Wf (recObjectTy fs)) (motive : TyWf) (k : Nat) : List TyWf :=
  (recObjectUnfold fs hwf).toList ++ [recObjectMap fs (recObjectAnswerTree fs motive k)]

/-! ## What a branch of a fold of a recursive **newtype** binds

A recursive newtype is in the same position as a recursive record: its body can never be
*literally* an occurrence of it, since `μX. X` is the equation `T = T`, which no value
satisfies (`LeanScript.Ty.not_wf_recAlias_self`).  So `TyWf.recBinders` hands the body
over as it is, with no value of the fold beside it
(`LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders_recAlias`), and the answers of a fold of a newtype are given
in the **shape of its body**: `TyWf.recAliasMap b X` is the body with every occurrence of
the newtype replaced by `X`, which for `T = Option T` and `X = τ` is `Option τ` — each
subvalue replaced by the value of the fold at it.

That is a depth-zero fold.  A **depth-`k`** one replaces each subvalue not by its answer
alone but by its `TyWf.recAliasAnswerTree` of depth `k`: the answer at it, together — in
the shape of the body — with the answer trees of depth `k - 1` of its own subvalues.  So
a branch reads the answers at everything `k + 1` levels down, along the path it descends,
exactly as the depth-`k` branch of `Term.recObject_rec` does. -/
