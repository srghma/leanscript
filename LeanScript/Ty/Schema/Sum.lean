# The schemas: enums and tagged unions

`LeanEnumSchema`, a sum whose constructors have no fields, and `LeanTaggedUnionSchema`, a
sum of at least two constructors one of which has a field.
-/

/-- The payload of an **enum**: a sum whose constructors all have no fields, printed as
    the plain numbers `shift`, `shift + 1`, ….

    The number of constructors is held as `extraConstructors`, the number *beyond the
    three an enum must have*, so an enum of fewer than three constructors is
    unwritable — see the header of `LeanScript.Ty.Schema` for why the three smaller cases
    are other types rather than small enums.  `shift` is an arbitrary `Int`, which is what unites
    an ordinary enum (`shift = 0`) with the ones whose numbering Lean fixes (`Ordering`
    is three constructors at `shift = -1`, printing as `-1 | 0 | 1`). -/
