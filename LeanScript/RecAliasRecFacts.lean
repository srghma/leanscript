# What the fold of a recursive newtype binds, and why it needs an answer window

`LeanScript.Term.recAlias_rec` is, beside `LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec`, the other fold
whose branch cannot be written with `LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders`.  `recBinders` puts the
value of the fold after a field that is **literally** an occurrence of the type being
folded over, and the body of a recursive newtype is never such a field: a body written
`Ty.self` states the equation `T = T`, which no value satisfies, so the tree is not a type
(`Ty.not_wf_recAlias_self`).

`recBinders_recAlias` below is that statement: at a recursive newtype the binders of the
old fold are *exactly* the binder of `Term.recAlias_casesOn`, so the plain fold handed its
branch no answer whatsoever.  What the depth-`k` fold hands it instead is one **lookback
window** binder — the newtype's own body with each subvalue replaced by its answer tree of
depth `k` (`TyWf.recAliasAnswerTree`) — and `recAliasRecBinders_zero` says that the
default depth is the old branch context with the one answer the old one was missing
appended to it.
