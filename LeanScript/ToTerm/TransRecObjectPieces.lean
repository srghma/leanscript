# The translation of a recursion on a recursive record: its pieces

What `LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecObject` reads a recursive record and its recursion into
(`RecObjInfo`, one `RecObjField` per field), and the pieces it builds the fold's case tree
from: the history handed to the Lean branch, a leaf of the case tree, and the answers at
the subvalues a field of list or array type holds.

inductive RecObjPayloadField where
  /-- A value that does not mention the record, of this Lean type. -/
  | plain (ty : Expr)
  /-- The record itself. -/
  | self
  /-- A value of a (non-recursive) structure (`Nat × Cell`): its constructor, universe
      levels and parameters, and how each of its fields is read. -/
  | struct (ctor : Name) (lvls : List Level) (params : Array Expr)
      (fields : Array RecObjPayloadField)
  /-- A value of a (non-recursive) union type (`Option Cell`, `Option (Nat × Cell)`): the
      inductive, its universe levels and parameters, and for each constructor its name
      and how each of its fields is read. -/
  | union (ind : Name) (lvls : List Level) (params : Array Expr)
      (ctors : Array (Name × Array RecObjPayloadField))
  /-- An array of values that mention the record (`Array Tree`, `Array (Array Tree)`,
      `Array (Option Tree)`, `Array (Nat × Tree)`), of the Lean type `ty` = `Array elemTy`,
      whose elements are read as `elem` says.  Lean folds it through two auxiliary
      motives, one for `Array elemTy` and one for `List elemTy`, and the window of the fold
      holds the array of the elements' windows; the answer of the array's own motive is
      the fold of that array (`array_rec`) by the branches of those two motives, each
      element's window taken apart as `elem` says. -/
  | array (ty elemTy : Expr) (elem : RecObjPayloadField)
  /-- A function into the record (`Nat → Tree`), of the Lean type `ty` = `dom → Tree`: a
      subvalue at every argument.  The window holds the function `dom ⇒ τ` of the answers
      at them, and the history Lean hands its branch is, at this field, the function
      `fun a => ⟨answer at (f a), …⟩`, so a read of the answer at `f a` is an application
      of the window.  Only the depth-`0` fold reads such a field. -/
  | fn (ty dom : Expr)
  /-- A delayed record (`Thunk Tree`), of the Lean type `ty`: Lean holds it as
      `Thunk.mk g` with `g : Unit → Tree`, and the window holds the delayed answer, whose
      forcing is the answer at `g ()`.  Only the depth-`0` fold reads such a field. -/
