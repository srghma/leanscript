# The translation: a structural recursion on a recursive record

`transRecObjectBrecOn?`, the clause of the translation for a structural recursion on a
**recursive record** — an inductive type with one constructor that mentions itself only
inside another type, such as

```lean
inductive Cell where
  | mk (label : Nat) (next : Option Cell)
```

whose tree is `Ty.recObject`.  Lean compiles such a recursion into `Cell.brecOn`, whose
branch is handed the whole history of the recursion; the grammar's fold of a record,
`LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec' k`, hands its branch the record's fields and a **window**:
the fields again, with every subvalue replaced by the *answer tree* of depth `k` at it
(`LeanScript.TyWf.recObjectRecBinders`).

**How the branch is read.**  At depth `k` the window is taken apart completely: the record
of fields at each level, a dispatch on each field that holds subvalues, and, for each
subvalue at levels `1 … k`, the answer tree there — the answer at it and the window of its
own fields.  The subvalues at level `k + 1` are the frontier: only their answers are in
the window.  Each leaf of that case tree fixes the **shape** of the value `k + 1` levels
down, so the Lean branch is instantiated at that shape — the labels, and the frontier
subvalues, as variables — and at the history built for it, whose entries are the
variables standing for the answers.  The branch then reduces: its `match` is taken
apart by the shape, and its reads of the history become those variables.

The depth is the smallest `k` at which, at every leaf, nothing is left of a frontier
subvalue or of the history below the frontier: a branch that reads the answer two cells
down (`fib`) is depth `1`, one that only reads the answer at the cell below (a sum, a
tail-recursive loop) is depth `0`.

The record's fields may be values that do not mention the record, or values of a
(non-recursive) union or structure type — `Option Cell`, `Nat × Cell` — whose fields are
read in the same way, or arrays of such values (`Array Cell`, `Array (Option Cell)`,
`Array (Array Cell)`): an array is a frontier value, and the answer of the recursion at it
(and at its list) is the fold of the window's array (`recObjListAnswer`).  A field may
also be a function into the record (`Nat → Cell`) or a delay of it (`Thunk Cell`), a
frontier value at every depth.  Its window is the function of the answer trees (or the
delayed answer tree): at depth `0` that is the function of the answers (the delayed
answer), and deeper the function of the answers, `fun a => (window a).1` (the delayed
answer, `Thunk.mk (window.get).1`), is bound beside it (`LeanScript.Term.fnTreeAnswer`, `LeanScript.Term.thunkTreeAnswer`,
whose values `LeanScript.RecFnFieldFacts` proves are the depth-`0` window).  Either way
the answer at `f a` is that function applied to `a`.  The value `f a` itself is never
taken apart: Lean's structural recursion does not accept a recursive call on what a
`match` on `f a` binds, so no branch does that.

A declaration of **several constructors** whose occurrences sit inside other types is a
recursive newtype whose body is the union of its constructors
(`LeanScript.Deriving.assembleShape`); its fold reads that body as a union field whose
constructors are the declaration's own (`RecObjInfo.unionAlias`).
