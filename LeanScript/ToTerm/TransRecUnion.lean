# The translation: a structural recursion on a recursive tagged union

`transRecUnionBrecOn?`, the clause of the translation for a structural recursion on a
**recursive tagged union** — an inductive type with several constructors whose fields are
either the type itself or values that do not mention it, such as

```lean
inductive Tree where
  | leaf
  | node (left : Tree) (val : Nat) (right : Tree)
```

whose tree is `Ty.recTaggedUnion`.  (`List α` is one too; `List.brecOn` comes here when
the one-step translation of `LeanScript.ToTerm.TransBrec` cannot serve it.)

Lean compiles such a recursion into `Tree.brecOn`, whose branch is handed the whole
history of the recursion; the grammar's fold, `LeanScript.Term.recTaggedUnion_rec' k`,
hands each branch the constructor's fields and the answers at its occurrences of the
union (`TyWf.recBinders`), and lets a branch **look further down**, at most `k` times:
dispatch again on one of those occurrences (`LeanScript.FoldKBranch.deep`), or on an
occurrence at a node above it that it has not looked into (`FoldKBranch.deepOuter`), and
be handed *its* fields and answers.

**How the branch is read.**  The case tree is built top down.  At each node the value's
shape is known down to that node: the constructors dispatched on along the path, and a
variable for every field not descended into.  The Lean branch is instantiated at that
shape and at the history built for it — whose entry at a subvalue that is bound is the
variable standing for the answer there, and whose deeper parts are unknown — and reduced.
If nothing unknown is left, that is the answer (`FoldKBranch.here`).  Otherwise the
unknown parts are the histories below subvalues not looked into yet, each a metavariable
whose type names its subvalue; when the depth allows it, each of those subvalues is tried
in turn as the one to look into — at this node (`FoldKBranch.deep`) or at a node above
(`FoldKBranch.deepOuter`), those furthest up first.  So a recursion that reads the
answers at the grandchildren below **both** children of a binary tree looks into the left
child and then, from there, into the right one: depth `2`.

The depth is the smallest `k` (up to `maxRecUnionRecDepth`) at which every branch is
served.
