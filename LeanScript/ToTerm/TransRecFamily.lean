# The translation: a structural recursion on a mutual recursive family

`transRecFamilyBrecOn?`, the clause of the translation for a structural recursion on the
members of a **mutual inductive block**, such as

```lean
mutual
  inductive A where
    | stop
    | next (label : Nat) (b : B)
  inductive B where
    | stop
    | next (label : Nat) (a : A)
end
```

whose trees are `Ty.mutualRecursiveFamily` (one per member, each selecting itself).

Lean compiles a (mutual) structural recursion on such a block into `A.brecOn` (or
`B.brecOn`), which takes one motive and one branch **per member** and hands each branch
the whole history of the recursion.  The grammar's fold,
`LeanScript.Term.mutualRecursiveFamily_rec' k`, takes the branches of every member of the
family, with one answer type `τ` for all of them, each branch binding the constructor's
fields and the answers at its occurrences of members (`TyWf.famRecBinders`), and lets a
branch **look further down**, at most `k` times, into an occurrence of any member: one of
the node it stands at (`LeanScript.FamilyFoldKBranch.deep`), or one it has not looked into
yet at a node above it on the path (`LeanScript.FamilyFoldKBranch.deepOuter`).

**How a branch is read** is what `LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecUnion` does for a single
recursive union: the case tree of each member is built top down, the Lean branch of that
member is instantiated at the shape known so far and at the history in which the answer
at each bound subvalue is its variable, and it is reduced.  If nothing unknown is left,
that is the answer (`FamilyFoldKBranch.here`).  Otherwise the unknown parts are the
histories below subvalues not looked into yet, each a metavariable whose type names its
subvalue; when the depth allows it, each of those subvalues is tried in turn as the one to
look into — at this node (`FamilyFoldKBranch.deep`) or at a node above
(`FamilyFoldKBranch.deepOuter`), those furthest up first.  So a recursion that reads the
answers at the grandchildren below **both** children of a binary node looks into the left
child and then, from there, into the right one: depth `2`.

**The answer type.**  Every member whose motive is a function to the answer type has its
branch translated.  A member whose motive is `PUnit` — Lean's choice when a recursion on
one member only passes *through* another, as in

```lean
def A.len : A → Nat
  | .stop => 0
  | .next _ .stop => 1
  | .next _ (.next _ a) => a.len + 2
```

— has no Lean branch to translate, and the fold still needs one for it; its branches
answer a default (of the `Inhabited` instance of the answer type, or else a value built
from its constructors, `LeanScript.ToTerm.synthDefault?`), an answer that no
branch of the translated members reads, since their Lean branches have no entry for it.

The depth is the smallest `k` (up to `maxRecFamilyRecDepth`) at which every branch is
served.
