# The translation: structural recursion

`transBrecOn`, the clause of the translation for a structural recursion as Lean compiled
it.  Like the clauses of `LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRec`, it takes the translation itself as
its first argument `trans`.

/-- The array whose elements an expression lists: `a` for `Array.toList a` (or the
    projection it unfolds to). -/
def arrayOfToList? (e : Expr) : Option Expr :=
  match e.consumeMData with
  | .proj ``Array 0 a => some a
  | e' =>
      match e'.getAppFnArgs with
      | (``Array.toList, #[_, a]) => some a
      | _ => none

/-- A structural recursion on a list, run on the **elements of an array**:
    `List.brecOn a.toList F`, which is what `go a.toList` unfolds to when `go` is a
    structurally recursive function on lists.  That is the fold of the array,
    `LeanScript.Term.array_rec k`.

    The depth `k` is found as for a `Nat`: the branch is instantiated at the list
    `hd :: y₁ :: … :: yₖ :: rest`, with the `k + 1` nearest entries of the history — the
    values at `y₁ :: … :: rest`, …, `rest` — replaced by variables, and the smallest `k`
    at which nothing of the history and of `rest` is left is the depth.  The branch of
    `array_rec` is given the head, the tail as an array and the fold values; an element
    `yᵢ` past the head that the branch reads is taken off the tail by `i` nested
    `array_casesOn`s (whose empty cases are never taken there: the tail has at least `k`
    elements).  A branch that reads the rest of the list after them is refused.

    The lists of at most `k` elements are the base answers (`LeanScript.ArrayRecBases`):
    the branch at `[x₁, …, xⱼ]`, each one reading the answers at its own suffixes. -/

/-- A structural recursion as Lean compiled it: `Nat.brecOn` or `List.brecOn`.

    The branch of a `brecOn` is given the **history** of the recursion — the value of the
    function at every smaller argument — and the grammar's folds give it the value at the
    immediate predecessor only.  So the history is reduced away here: the branch is
    instantiated at the two constructors of its type, with the head of the history
    replaced by a variable standing for the value at the predecessor, and what is left is
    the pair of branches of `Nat.rec` / `List.rec`, which
    `LeanScript.ToTerm.transRecCore` turns into `nat_rec` / `recTaggedUnion_rec` (or the
    case analysis, when the branch does not use that value).

    On a `Nat` the depth is not fixed at one.  If the branch at `n + 1` reads more of the
    history than its head, the depths `1, 2, …` are tried in turn: at depth `k` the
    branch is instantiated at `n + k + 1` with the `k + 1` nearest entries of the history
    replaced by variables, and the first depth at which nothing of the history is left is
    the depth of the `nat_rec` that is built — with the answers below it, the branch at
    `0, …, k`, as its base values.  A recursion that reads the history at an argument
    that is not a fixed number of steps back is refused. -/
