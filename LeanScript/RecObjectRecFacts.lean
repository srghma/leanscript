# What the fold of a recursive record binds, and why it needs an answer window

`LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec` is the one fold whose branch cannot be written with
`LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders`, the binders every other fold uses.  `recBinders` puts the
value of the fold after a field that is **literally** an occurrence of the type being
folded over, and a recursive record never has such a field: a record has values only when
all of its fields do, so a field written `Ty.self` would leave the record with no value at
all and the tree would not be a type (`Ty.not_wf_recObject_self`).

`recBinders_recObject` below is that statement: at a recursive record the binders of the
old fold are *exactly* the binders of `Term.recObject_casesOn`, so the plain fold handed
its branch no answer whatsoever.  What the depth-`k` fold hands it instead is one
**lookback window** binder — the record's own fields with each subvalue replaced by its
answer tree of depth `k` (`TyWf.recObjectAnswerTree`) — and `recObjectRecBinders_zero`
says that the default depth is the old branch context with the one answer the old one was
missing appended to it.
