# `Term`: the one grammar, terminating by construction

The grammar itself: `Term` and the families of branches it dispatches through, as one
`mutual` block.  The prose that explains the recursion discipline, and how this block
came to be, is in `LeanScript.Expr.Design`.

**No `DecidableEq`/`BEq`.**  The float literals (`Term.float_mk`, `Term.float32_mk`,
`Term.floatModel_mk`, `Term.float32Model_mk`) are not what prevents it: `Float`, `Float32`
and their models have `DecidableEq`.  What does is that some constructors hold
**functions**: `Term.externCall` and `Term.externCallChecked` hold
`call : TyWf.DenList σs → Extern τ` (resp. `→ Option (Extern τ)`), and `Term.extern` holds
a `LeanScript.Extern`, which has no decidable equality either (see
`LeanScript.LeanInitPureExtern`).  Equality of such functions cannot be decided.

/-- A term of the language, in **strict A-normal form**: a block of `let`s, each naming the
    value of one computation step (`LeanScript.Comp`), ending in a **tail**: the return of
    a variable, a jump to a join point, or a dispatch or a fold.  It is typed, in
    a context `Γ` of the types in scope, a context `J` of the join points in scope (their
    argument types; every one of them answers with `τ`), and against the signature `Sg` of
    the module's top-level declarations.  It has no fixpoint constructor, no effect and no
    partial operation: every loop is a fold (a `while` loop is accepted by the translator
    only when it is a structural recursion, and is then a `Term.nat_rec`), so its
    evaluator is total and structural.

    Strict A-normal form is a property of the *type*: the operands of every step are atoms
    (`LeanScript.Atom`), which are **variables only** — a declaration and a literal are
    steps, named by a `let` like any other; a `let` binds a `LeanScript.Comp`, never
    another `let`, never a mere variable (there is no copy `let x = y`), never a dispatch
    and never a fold; a block ends by returning a variable (`Term.ret`), so a step is never
    in tail position unnamed; and a dispatch or a fold is always the last thing a block
    does.  A dispatch whose value is used by what follows is written with a **join point**
    (`Term.letJ`): what follows becomes the join point, and each branch ends by jumping to
    it (`Term.jump`).  A fold delivers its answer to a `LeanScript.Dest`: either it is the
    value of the term, or it is passed to a join point.  Join points live in their own
    context `J`, apart from the variables, and they are not values: they can only be jumped
    to, from tail position, and a function body, a delay or a fold branch starts with none.

    `J` is an `optParam` that defaults to `[]`, so `Term Sg Γ τ` is a term with no join
    point in scope — a whole function body.  The functions named like the constructors of
    the direct-style grammar (`LeanScript.Term.ap`, `LeanScript.Term.nat_rec`, …, in
    `LeanScript.Expr.Build`) take arbitrary terms and put them in this form. -/
inductive Term (Sg : Sig) : Ctx → TyWf → optParam JCtx [] → Type 1
  /-- `ret x` — the end of a block: the value of the variable `x` is the value of the
      term.  Only a variable can be returned: a computation whose value is the term's is
      bound by a `let` first (`let x = c; ret x`), so every step of a block is named, and a
      block has one shape whatever its last step is. -/

  /-- A pure extern of `Init` that takes a proof, applied to the terms of its arguments.
      The language erases propositions, so the proof is not in hand when the term runs:
      `call` **decides** the proposition on the values of the arguments and builds the
      entry of the catalogue with the proof it gets (`fun vs => if h : vs.2.1 < vs.1.size
      then some (.lean_array_fget αt vs.1 vs.2.1 h) else none`), and the value is
      `Extern.eval` of it.  Where the proposition does not hold — which cannot happen in a
      term translated from a Lean program, since that program had to supply the proof —
      the value is `fallback`'s. -/

      It is terminating by construction, at every depth: the branch is *given* the answers

  /-- **The fold of a mutual family**, that descends `k + 1` constructors at a time: the
      branches of *every* member of the family, in declaration order, each binding its
      fields and, right after a field that is an occurrence of a member, the value of the
      fold at that field (`TyWf.famRecBinders`) — and, right after a field that holds
      members *inside* it (an `Array`, a function or a `Thunk` of members, `List (Array T)`),
      the values of the fold at those members in the field's shape
      (`TyWf.famAnswerBinders`) — and each branch free to **look further
      down** — to dispatch on one of those occurrences again, whichever member it belongs
      to, or on an occurrence it has not looked into yet at a node above it on the path
      (`LeanScript.FamilyFoldKBranch.deepOuter`), and so be given *its* fields and the
      values of the fold at them.  One motive
      `τ` answers for every member, which is what lets one list of branches describe the
      whole family, and it is what a deeper look into another member answers with too.

      `LeanScript.FamilyFoldKCases` is that case tree; a branch may stop looking at any
      point, and at depth `k` it may descend at most `k` times.  At the default depth
      `k = 0` this is the plain fold: no branch can descend, so the branches are exactly
      one term each, in the context that binds the member's fields and the values of the
      fold at its occurrences (`LeanScript.FamilyRecFacts` proves the two families are
      the same at that depth).  At depth `1` a branch reads the answer at a field *and*
      at that field's own occurrences — which is what a `fib`-shaped recursion over a
      family does, reading the answer two constructors down, possibly through another
      member.

      The recursive value is *given* to the branch rather than called by it, exactly as
      in `Term.nat_rec`, `Term.array_rec` and `Term.recTaggedUnion_rec`, and a deeper
      look is taken only into a **subvalue** (`LeanScript.FamilyMemberField` and
      `LeanScript.FamilyOuterMemberField` pick the occurrence descended into), so a term is still terminating by construction, at
      every depth. -/

/-- The branches of a dispatch on **some** of the constructors of a tagged union, used

    `LeanScript.Term.taggedUnion_mk`, written by `ctor_tag` unless it is given, and the
    branch binds that constructor's fields.  A constructor may be left out — that is the
    point — and `LeanScript.Term.taggedUnion_casesOnWithDefault` supplies the branch it
    then takes.

    The list is **validated by its type**, exactly as `LeanScript.EnumSomeCases` is, so a
    dispatch that is not well formed cannot be written at all:

    * the constructor numbers **strictly increase**, and so are in order and no number is

      still name, and the tail after the branch of `t` starts at `t + 1`;
    * there is **at least one** branch: the list ends with `last`, not with an empty
      case, so a `LeanScript.Term.taggedUnion_casesOnWithDefault` that names nothing —
      which is just its default — is unwritable.

    The list also **counts its branches**, in the index `k`, which is what
    `LeanScript.Term.taggedUnion_casesOnWithDefault` compares with the number of
    constructors of the union: a list that names *every* constructor is an exhaustive
    dispatch whose default is unreachable, and the bound `k < l.length` there makes it
    unwritable.

    `lo` is an `optParam` that starts at `0`, so `TaggedUnionSomeCases Sg Γ l τ k` is the

    then takes.

    The list is **validated by its type**, so a dispatch that is not well formed cannot

    * the constructor numbers **strictly increase**, and so are in order and no number

    The list also **counts its branches**, in the index `k`, which is what
    `LeanScript.Term.enum_casesOnWithDefault` compares with the number of constructors of

    The list is indexed by the **schema** of the enum it dispatches on, exactly as
    `LeanScript.TaggedUnionSomeCases` is indexed by the schema of its union, so branches
    written for one enum are not branches for another.

    `lo` is an `optParam` that starts at `0`, so `EnumSomeCases Sg Γ τ s k` is the type of

/-- The branches of a dispatch on, or a **fold** over, a sum type: one per constructor,
    in constructor order, **indexed by the schema itself** rather than by the list of
    constructors it denotes.  So the family has the same shape as
    `LeanScript.LeanTaggedUnionSchema`: a schema whose first constructor carries fields
    wants that constructor's branch, the branch of the constructor that must follow it,
    and then the branches of the rest; a schema that starts with field-less constructors
    wants a branch for each of them, through `LeanScript.CtorsWithPayloadFoldCases`.

    A branch binds `bind` of its constructor's field types, in declaration order.  A
    plain dispatch (`LeanScript.TaggedUnionCases`) is the family at `ι := TyWf` and
    `bind := id`: a branch binds the **fields** of its constructor, so de Bruijn index `0`
    of its body is that constructor's first field.

    `bind` is how the value of the fold reaches the branch: `LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders`
    binds each field, unfolded, and follows a field that is an occurrence of the type
    being folded over by the value of the fold at it, and
    `LeanScript.TyWf.famRecBinders` does the same for a member of a mutual family.  The
    schema the family is indexed by is the one the binder holds — written in *its* scope,
    not unfolded — because that is what says which fields are occurrences, and `ι` is
    what that scope is: `TyWfIn 1` for a lone binder, `TyWfIn (n + 2)` for a family.

/-- **What one branch of a depth-`k` fold of a recursive tagged union is**: either an
    answer, or a deeper look.

    `here` is an answer: a term in the context that binds the constructor's fields and,
    after each field that is an occurrence of the union, the value of the fold at it —
    `bind fs ++ Γ`, which is the branch of the plain fold.

    `deep` is a look one constructor further down: it names an occurrence among the
    fields (`LeanScript.SelfField`) and dispatches on it, with a depth one smaller, in
    that same context.  Each of *those* branches binds that subvalue's fields and the
    values of the fold at them, so a branch of the whole tree sees the answers at
    everything on the path it descended.

    `deepOuter` is a look into an occurrence among the fields of a node **above** this
    one, which the fold dispatched on earlier along the path (`LeanScript.OuterSelfField`):
    after looking into a node's left child a branch can still look into its right child,
    and so read the answers below **both**.  `outer` lists those nodes, innermost first;
    it is `[]` at the root, and a deeper look pushes the node it stands at.

    A look is only ever taken into a field of a node on the path, so every answer a
    branch is given is the answer at a **subvalue** of the value being folded.  Each look
    costs one unit of depth, so at depth `k` a branch looks at most `k` times in all.

    At depth `0` there is no `deep` and no `deepOuter`, so a branch is an answer and
    nothing else. -/

/-- **What one branch of a depth-`k` fold of a mutual family is**: either an answer, or a
    deeper look.  It is `LeanScript.FoldKBranch` in the scope of a family.

    `here` is an answer: a term in the context that binds the constructor's fields and,
    after each field that is an occurrence of a member of the family, the value of the
    fold at it — `bind fs ++ Γ`, which is the branch of the plain fold.

    `deep` is a look one constructor further down: it names a field that is an occurrence
    of member `i` (`LeanScript.FamilyMemberField`), says which member of the family that
    is (`LeanScript.FamilyMemberAt`), and dispatches on **that member** — which need not
    be the member the branch belongs to — with a depth one smaller, in that same context.
    Each of those branches binds the
    subvalue's fields and the values of the fold at them, so a branch of the whole tree
    sees the answers at everything on the path it descended.

    `deepOuter` is a look into an occurrence among the fields of a node **above** this
    one, which the fold dispatched on earlier along the path
    (`LeanScript.FamilyOuterMemberField`): after looking into one field of a node a branch
    can still look into another, and so read the answers below **several** subvalues.
    `outer` lists those nodes, innermost first; it is `[]` at the root, and a deeper look
    pushes the node it stands at.

    A look is only ever taken into a field of a node on the path, so every answer a branch
    is given is the answer at a **subvalue** of the value being folded.  Each look costs
    one unit of depth, so at depth `k` a branch looks at most `k` times in all.

    `ms₀` is the whole family — every member, in declaration order — because that is
    what says which member `i` names; at depth `0` there is no `deep` and no `deepOuter`,
    so a branch is an answer and nothing else. -/

/-! ## Plain dispatches

A plain dispatch on a tagged union is the fold-case family at `ι := TyWf` and
`bind := id`, so a branch's context `id fs ++ Γ` is `fs ++ Γ` by definition.  These
abbreviations are the names the rest of the project uses for it. -/

/-- The branches of a dispatch on a tagged union: one per constructor, in constructor
    order, each binding its constructor's fields, and no default — exhaustive by
    construction.  It is `LeanScript.TaggedUnionFoldCases` at `ι := TyWf`, `bind := id`. -/
abbrev TaggedUnionCases (Sg : Sig) (Γ : Ctx) (l : LeanTaggedUnionSchema TyWf) (τ : TyWf)
    (J : JCtx := []) : Type 1 :=
  TaggedUnionFoldCases Sg TyWf id Γ l τ J

/-- The branches of the constructors a `LeanScript.CtorsWithPayload` holds: the tail of
    `LeanScript.TaggedUnionCases`. -/
