# Which terms does the evaluator evaluate?

**All of them.**  `Term.eval` is a total function on every term: every type of the language
has values in the model `TyWf.Den` — a recursive *tagged union*, a recursive *record* and
a recursive *newtype* denote the W-tree of their payload, and a *mutual family* the
indexed W-tree of its members — so every introduction form, the one of a mutual family
included, has a value.  This file checks, with the kernel, that

* a closed term such as `natNil` (the empty list of naturals) runs, and so do the
  eliminators applied to it: `natHead` and `natFoldZero` are told apart;
* so does a rose tree (a recursive record), which the evaluator builds and takes apart;
* so does a member of a mutual family, which the evaluator builds and dispatches on; the
  statements that held when a family denoted an empty type — that no function at all
  could send every closed term to a value of its type — are kept, commented out, as the
  record of what changed, and `total_evaluator` is that function.
