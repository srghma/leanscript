# `recAlias_rec k`, produced by `#leanscript_to_term` from Lean programs

`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` tests `LeanScript.Term.nat_rec k` by translating `fib`,
`tribonacci`, `tetranacci`, `pentanacci`, … ; `TermTests/ArrayRecToTermTest/`,
`TermTests/RecUnionToTermTest/` and `TermTests/RecObjectToTermTest/` do the same for
`array_rec k`, `recTaggedUnion_rec k` and `recObject_rec k`.  These files do it for
`LeanScript.Term.recAlias_rec k`, the fold of a **recursive newtype** that reads `k + 1`
levels at a time.

**Which Lean program is a `recAlias_rec k`.**  A recursive newtype is an inductive type with
**one** constructor of **one** field that mentions the type itself inside another type (it
has to: `μX. X` has no values).  Its tree is `Ty.recAlias body`, the wrapper erased.  The
one used here is a chain of labelled links:

```lean
inductive Link (α : Type) where
  | stop
  | step (label : Nat) (rest : α)

inductive Chain where
  | mk (link : Link Chain)
```

whose tree is `Ty.recAlias (stop | step nat self)` (checked below).  Lean compiles an
ordinary structural recursion on `Chain` into `Chain.brecOn`, and the translation reads it
as `recAlias_rec k` (`LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecObject`, which serves recursive records
and recursive newtypes alike).  The programs are written as ordinary Lean, with no
`decreasing_by` and nothing added for the translation.

The depth `k` is the smallest one for which every branch reads only the labels and the
values of the recursion at the links at most `k + 1` levels down, which is what the
**window** of `recAlias_rec k` holds (`LeanScript.TyWf.recAliasRecBinders`).

One file per depth, `K0.lean` … `K4.lean`.  Each program is checked three ways:

* the translated term **is** a `recAlias_rec` of the expected depth (`recAliasRecDepth?`);
* the term computes the expected numbers;
* the term computes what the Lean definition computes.

The inputs are built by translated Lean programs too: `Chain.ofNat n` (a chain of `n`
links, a `nat_rec` whose branch builds a link with `recAlias_mk`), `Chain.ofList l` (a
fold of a list) and a literal chain.

The equations are checked by `kernel_rfl` rather than `rfl`: the elaborator's own check of
such an equation runs out of heartbeats, while the kernel checks it quickly (see
`LeanScript/KernelRfl.lean`).  `kernel_rfl` is still a proof by `Eq.refl`, checked by the
kernel.
