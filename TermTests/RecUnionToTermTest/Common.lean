# `recTaggedUnion_rec k`, produced by `#leanscript_to_term` from Lean programs

`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` tests `LeanScript.Term.nat_rec k` by translating `fib`,
`tribonacci`, `tetranacci`, `pentanacci`, … ; `TermTests/ArrayRecToTermTest/` does the same
for `LeanScript.Term.array_rec k` and `TermTests/RecObjectToTermTest/` for
`LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec k`.  These files do it for
`LeanScript.Term.recTaggedUnion_rec k`, the fold of a **recursive tagged union** whose
branches may look `k` times further down, into one subvalue or into several.

**Which Lean program is a `recTaggedUnion_rec k`.**  Any structural recursion on an
inductive type whose tree is `Ty.recTaggedUnion` — several constructors, each field
either the type itself or a value that does not mention it.  Lean compiles it into
`X.brecOn`, and the translation (`LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecUnion`) reads it as
`recTaggedUnion_rec k`, where `k` is the smallest depth at which every branch is served
by the constructor's fields, the answers at its subvalues, and at most `k` looks — each
into a subvalue of the node the branch stands at (`LeanScript.FoldKBranch.deep`) or of a
node above it (`LeanScript.FoldKBranch.deepOuter`).  The programs are written as ordinary
Lean, with no annotation and nothing added for the translation.

`BothSubtrees.lean` has programs that read below several subvalues at once (the sum of
the labels at even levels, which reads the grandchildren below both children), and
`Refused.lean` one the translation refuses.

One file per depth, `K0.lean` … `K4.lean`, each with programs on three datatypes (the
datatypes, and the inputs built for them, are defined here):

* `List Nat`, one recursive point: the depth-`k` programs are the
  Fibonacci-like recursions of `TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` on the length of the list.
* `Tree` (`leaf | node left val right`), two recursive points: the
  deeper looks go down the left spine or the right spine.
* `Tree3` (`leaf val | node a b c`), three recursive points: the deeper
  looks go down the first, the middle or the last child.

Each program is checked three ways:

* the translated term **is** a `recTaggedUnion_rec` of the expected depth;
* the term computes the expected numbers;
* the term computes what the Lean definition computes.

The inputs are built by translated Lean programs too (e.g. `Tree.full n`, a `nat_rec`
whose branch builds nodes with `recTaggedUnion_mk`).

The equations are checked by `kernel_rfl` rather than `rfl`: the elaborator's own check of
such an equation fails or runs out of heartbeats, while the kernel checks it quickly (see
`LeanScript/KernelRfl.lean`).  `kernel_rfl` is still a proof by `Eq.refl`, checked by the
kernel.

/-- The depth of the `recTaggedUnion_rec` a translated function is: the fold under the
    `fun`s of its arguments, applied to the arguments that Lean put in the motive.  `none`

/-! ## `List Nat` (one recursive point)

`List Nat` is the recursive tagged union `nil | cons nat self`.  A program that matches
`k + 1` conses deep is `recTaggedUnion_rec k`: each deeper look goes into the tail. -/

/-! ## `Tree`, a binary tree (two recursive points)

`Tree` is the recursive tagged union `leaf | node self nat self`.  A branch of
`recTaggedUnion_rec k` is given a node's subtrees, its label, and the answers at both
subtrees; a deeper look goes into **one** subtree — the programs at `k ≥ 1` read
`k + 1` levels down the left spine (`.here`) or the right spine (`.there (.there .here)`),
while still using the answers at the other subtrees. -/

/-! ## `Tree3`, a ternary tree (three recursive points)

`Tree3` is the recursive tagged union `leaf nat | node self self self` — its first
constructor carries a field, so its schema starts with `payloadFirst`, unlike `List` and
`Tree`.  A branch of `recTaggedUnion_rec k` is given a node's three subtrees and the
answers at all three; a deeper look goes into **one** of them — the programs at `k ≥ 1`
descend the first child (`.here`), the middle child (`.there .here`) or the last
child (`.there (.there .here)`). -/
