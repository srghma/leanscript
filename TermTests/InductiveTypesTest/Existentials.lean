/-! ### `mixedProcess` and `varyingProcess`, as terms

Both values are closed, so every existential witness they use is known, and each value
is described with ordinary records, tagged unions and functions of the language. The
existential is simply replaced, at each constructor application, by the witness that
application uses.

`#leanscript_to_term` does this on its own.  `Process` and `ProcessOption` have no
`LeanScriptTyWf` instance, so a constructor application of either is built by the
**constructor function** of `#leanscript_ctor` (`LeanScript.CtorFn`), generated the first
time and reused from its cache after that:

* `Process` has existentials, so each of its constructors builds its own layout:
  `Process.step S seed trans` is the record `{ seed : S, trans : S ⇒ transTy }`, and
  `Process.halt H get` has one field, so it is that field, `H ⇒ nat`;
* `ProcessOption α S` has no existential of its own (its `State` is its index), so it is
  one tagged union, `none | some (nextState : S) (value : α) (proc : procTy)` with Lean's
  tags (`none` = 0, `some` = 1);
* `transTy` and `procTy` — the trees of the fields whose type is `Process`/`ProcessOption`
  itself — are read off the translation of those fields: the type of the term follows the
  value, and is inferred rather than written;
* a witness that is `Unit` is erased as everywhere in the language: the constructor function
  generated for that use (`…_erased01`) drops the `Unit` field `seed` and the `Unit` binder
  of `trans`;
* where values built with *different* witnesses meet (the two branches of the `if` in
  `varyingProcess`), the two types are joined: the value is injected into `TyWf.oneOf`, the
  tagged union with one constructor per layout that occurs there.

The one free choice is the type of `proc` in a `ProcessOption` in which only `none` is ever
built (the inner transitions of `varyingProcess`): no process is ever stored there, so any
closed type works, and `nat` is used.

Arithmetic and string append are external to the language, so they are the two
declarations of the signature `ProcessModel.sig`, named after `Nat.add` and
`String.append`, which `n + 1` and `s ++ "!"` unfold to. The `example`s at the end check,
by `rfl`, that each term evaluates to the Lean definition with the witnesses filled in.

/-- `Process.halt H get`: its one field, `get : H ⇒ nat`. -/
