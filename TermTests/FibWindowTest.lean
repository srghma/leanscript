# `fib` in the grammar as it stands: the sliding-window fold

`proposals/FibProposals.md` proposes five ways to give the language a recursion that descends more
than one step at a time.  This file *runs* the first of them, the one that needs no new
constructor (the grammar has since gained the depth-indexed node as well): a recursion that reads its own value at `n` and at `n + 1` is a fold whose
value is the **window** of the last two answers, a record of two `nat`s, and the answer
is the first field of that window.

Everything here is a term of the grammar exactly as it is today — `Term.nat_rec`,
`Term.record_mk`, `Term.record_casesOn` — produced by `#leanscript_to_term` from the Lean
program that computes the window, with the terms written out beside them in `example`s;
and `fib_term_eval` proves that the term's
value **is** `fib n`, at every `n`, rather than only at the arguments a test would try.

/-- The definition to be expressed: it reads its own value at `n` and at `n + 1`.  Since
    this file was written the grammar has gained the depth-indexed fold
    `Term.nat_rec k`, so `#leanscript_to_term` translates it directly
    (`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/`); what is written here is the *other* way of saying
    it, as a one-step fold whose value is a window, and it still typechecks and still
    computes `fib`. -/

/-- The step of the fold: it binds the predecessor `k` (index `0`) and the window at `k`
    (index `1`), takes the window apart — so inside, index `0` is `fib k` and index `1`
    is `fib (k + 1)` — and answers with the window at `k + 1`,
    `(fib (k + 1), fib k + fib (k + 1))`.

    The recursion that the branch of the Lean definition writes at `n` and at `n + 1` is
    read off the window: nothing is called, so the term is still terminating by
    construction. -/

/-! ## The semantics a two-step fold would have

`proposals/FibProposals.md`'s second proposal adds a constructor `Term.nat_rec2` whose branch is
given the value of the recursion at the **two** predecessors.  Its clause in the
evaluator would be the fold below, and the point of writing it here is that it is
*linear*: the fold carries the window internally, so a branch that reads both
predecessors still costs one step per number, which a naive double recursion would not.

`natFold2_succ_succ` is the equation such a constructor promises, and it is proved, so
the design is checked rather than asserted. -/

/-- `Nat.rec` that descends two steps: the value at `n + 2` is the branch applied to the
    values at `n` and at `n + 1`. -/
