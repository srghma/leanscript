# `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k`, produced by `#leanscript_to_term` from Lean programs

`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` tests `LeanScript.Term.nat_rec k` by translating `fib`,
`tribonacci`, `tetranacci`, `pentanacci`, … ; the other `…ToTermTest/` directories do the
same for the other folds.  These files do it for
`LeanScript.Term.mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k`, the fold of a **mutual recursive family**,
whose branches may look `k` constructors further down, one subvalue at a time, into any
member of the family.

**Which Lean program is a `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k`.**  A structural recursion on a
member of a `mutual … end` block of inductive types.  Each member's tree is
`Ty.mutualRecursiveFamily`, selecting that member.  Lean compiles the recursion into
`A.brecOn` (or `B.brecOn`), which takes a branch per member, and the translation
(`LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecFamily`) reads it as `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k`.  The
programs are written as ordinary Lean — `mutual … end` blocks of functions, or a single
function that goes *through* the other member — with no annotation and nothing added for
the translation.

The main family is two chains of labelled links that alternate:

```lean
mutual
  inductive A where
    | stop
    | next (label : Nat) (b : B)
  inductive B where
    | stop
    | next (label : Nat) (a : A)
end
```

and the depth-`k` programs are the Fibonacci-like recursions of
`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` on the number of links, written as a pair of mutual
functions.  `K0.lean` also folds two families whose members have other shapes: `Ev`/`Od`
(`Od` has one constructor of one field, so it is a *newtype* member) and `Tm`/`Pr` (`Pr`
has one constructor of two fields, so it is a *record* member).

One file per depth, `K0.lean` … `K4.lean`.  Each program is checked three ways:

* the translated term **is** a `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec` of the expected depth
  (`familyRecDepth?`);
* the term computes the expected numbers;
* the term computes what the Lean definition computes.

The inputs are built by translated Lean programs too: `A.ofNat n` and `B.ofNat n` (a
`nat_rec` whose branch builds links with `mutualRecursiveFamily_mk`) and literal values.

The equations are checked by `kernel_rfl` rather than `rfl`: the elaborator's own check of
such an equation runs out of heartbeats, while the kernel checks it quickly (see
`LeanScript/KernelRfl.lean`).  `kernel_rfl` is still a proof by `Eq.refl`, checked by the
kernel.
