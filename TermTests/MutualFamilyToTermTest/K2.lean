/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 2`: programs that read 3 links down

Part of the `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k` translation tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/Common.lean` for what is checked.  `aTrib_with_k2` and
`bTrib_with_k2` are the `tribonacci` recursion of `TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` on the
number of links, written as a pair of mutual functions: the branch of an `A` link reads
the answers at the next 3 links, which alternate between `B` and `A`, so it looks 2 times
into a subvalue of the other member or of its own. -/
