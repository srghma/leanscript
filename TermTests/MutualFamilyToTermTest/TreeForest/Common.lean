# `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k` on **mutual trees**: a tree and its forest

The classic mutual pair: a tree is a label and a forest of children, a forest is a list
of trees.

```lean
mutual
  inductive Tree where
    | node (label : Nat) (kids : Forest)
  inductive Forest where
    | nil
    | cons (t : Tree) (rest : Forest)
end
```

Unlike the chains of `TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/Common.lean`, a member has a
constructor with **two** occurrences (`Forest.cons` holds a `Tree` and a `Forest`), and a
member (`Tree`) has a single constructor, so it is a *record* member of the family.  A
depth-`k` program looks `k` times, along one path, alternately into forests and trees:
the first child of a node is two looks down (into the forest, then into its first tree).

One file per depth, `K0.lean` … `K3.lean`; each program is checked as in
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/Common.lean`: the depth of the translated fold, some
numbers, and agreement with the Lean definition on trees built by translated programs
(`Tree.full`, `Tree.spine`, `Forest.leaves`) and on a written-out tree.
