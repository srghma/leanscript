/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 1` on mutual trees: one look

Part of the tree-and-forest tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/TreeForest/Common.lean`.  At depth `1` the branch of a
node may look into its forest (to see whether it is empty, or its first tree's answer),
and the branch of a forest may look into its first tree. -/

/-! ## The number of leaves: the branch of a node looks into its forest

A node is a leaf when its forest is empty, which the branch of `Tree.node` sees only by
looking into the forest. -/

A function on `Forest` alone (it never calls itself on a tree), so Lean compiles it with
the motive of `Tree` set to `PUnit`. -/
