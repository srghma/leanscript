/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0` on mutual trees

Part of the tree-and-forest tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/TreeForest/Common.lean` for the family and for what is
checked.  At depth `0` a branch reads only the answers at the occurrences it holds: a
node's answer from its forest's, a forest's from its first tree's and the rest's.  Sums
and sizes, a sum by level (the level after the tree, so the fold answers a function), a
three-argument version, and a `match` that does not recurse (a `casesOn`, no fold). -/

/-! ## Two arguments: the sum of `level · label`, the level after the tree

The level is in Lean's motive, so the fold answers a function `Nat → Nat`, and the
forest passes the *same* level to all its trees while a node passes the next one down. -/
