/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 3` on mutual trees: three looks

Part of the tree-and-forest tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/TreeForest/Common.lean`.  At depth `3` the branch of a
node may read the answers at its first grandchild: into the forest, into its first tree,
into that tree's forest. -/

/-! ## Fibonacci down the first-child spine: three looks

The answer at a node reads the answers at its first child and at *that* child's first
child: into the forest, into its first tree, and into that tree's forest. -/
