/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 2` on mutual trees: two looks

Part of the tree-and-forest tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/TreeForest/Common.lean`.  At depth `2` the branch of a
node may read its first child — a look into the forest and a look into its first tree —
or the answers at its first two children. -/
