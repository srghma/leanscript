# `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k`: looks into several subvalues

The programs of `TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/` (`K0.lean` … `K4.lean` and the
subdirectories) read below one subvalue at a time.  The programs of this directory read
below **several**: after a deeper look into one field of a node, a branch looks into
another field of that node, or of a node further up the path it came down
(`LeanScript.FamilyFoldKBranch.deepOuter`).  Each look costs one unit of depth, so reading
the grandchildren below both children of a binary node is depth `2`, as for
`recTaggedUnion_rec` (`TermTests/RecUnionToTermTest/BothSubtrees.lean`).

The family used here is a binary tree whose levels alternate between two members, so that
every look goes into the *other* member:

```lean
mutual
  inductive ETree where
    | leaf
    | node (l : OTree) (v : Nat) (r : OTree)
  inductive OTree where
    | leaf
    | node (l : ETree) (v : Nat) (r : ETree)
end
```

`TreeForest.lean` does the same on the tree-and-forest family of
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/TreeForest/`.

Each program is checked as in `TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/Common.lean`: the depth of
the translated fold, some numbers, and agreement with the Lean definition on trees built
by translated programs and on a written-out tree.
