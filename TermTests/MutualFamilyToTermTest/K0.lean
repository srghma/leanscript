/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0`: programs that read the answers one constructor down

Part of the `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k` translation tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/Common.lean` for what is checked.  At depth `0` a branch
of each member is given the constructor's fields and the answers at its occurrences of
members, and nothing below them. -/

branch binds its body — an `Ev` — and the answer there. -/
