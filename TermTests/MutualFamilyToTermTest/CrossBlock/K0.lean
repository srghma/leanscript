/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0` on a family that holds another family

Part of the cross-family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/CrossBlock/Common.lean` for the families and for what
is checked.  At depth `0` a branch reads the answers at its own occurrences, and folds or
takes apart the values of `A` and `B` it holds. -/

/-! ## The sum of all labels: a fold of `A`/`B` inside each branch

The branch of `C.leaf` folds its `A` chain and the branch of `D.mk` folds its `B` chain:
the term is a `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0` of `C`/`D` whose branches hold
`mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0`s of `A`/`B`. -/
