/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 3` on a family that holds another family: three looks

Part of the cross-family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/CrossBlock/Common.lean`.  At depth `3` the branch of a
`C` node reads down to the `C` of the second node below it: `D`, `C`,
`D`, `C`. -/

/-! ## Three looks, and the other family folded at the bottom

The branch of a node reads the `B` chains of the next two nodes and the `C` below them —
`D`, `C`, `D`, then the `C`, whose answer it reads — and folds the `A` chain of the leaf,
if it is within reach. -/
