/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 4` on a family that holds another family: four looks

Part of the cross-family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/CrossBlock/Common.lean`.  At depth `4` the branch of a
`C` node reads down to the answer of the `D` of the third node below it. -/

/-! ## Tribonacci on the number of nodes: four looks

The answer at a node reads the answers at the next three nodes; the third is the answer
at a `D`, five occurrences down (a node is a `C` and a `D`). -/
