/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 1` on a family that holds another family: one look

Part of the cross-family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/CrossBlock/Common.lean`.  At depth `1` the branch of a
`C` node may look into its `D` record, and the branch of a `D` into its `C`, and fold or
take apart the values of the other family found there. -/

/-! ## The branch of a `C` node looks into its `D`
