/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 2` on a family that holds another family: two looks

Part of the cross-family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/CrossBlock/Common.lean`.  At depth `2` the branch of a
`C` node may look into its `D` and then into that `D`'s `C`. -/

/-! ## Fibonacci on the number of nodes: two looks, into the `D` and into its `C`

The answer at a node reads the answers at the next node (one look into its `D`) and at
the node after (a second look, into that `D`'s `C`). -/
