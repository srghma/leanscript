# `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k` on a family of **three** members

`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/K0.lean` … `K4.lean` fold families of two members.
These files fold a family of three, whose occurrences go round in a cycle:

```lean
mutual
  inductive X where | stop | next (label : Nat) (y : Y)
  inductive Y where | stop | next (label : Nat) (z : Z)
  inductive Z where | stop | next (label : Nat) (x : X)
end
```

so a program that reads `k + 1` links down passes through all three members, in turn,
and its branch for an `X` link looks into a `Y` link, then a `Z` link, then an `X` link
again.  `K0.lean` also folds `M1`/`M2`/`M3` below, a family of three members of the
three different shapes a member can have (constructors, a record, a newtype).

One file per depth, `K0.lean` … `K3.lean`.  Each program is checked three ways, as in
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/Common.lean`: the translated term is a
`mutualRecursiveFamily_rec` of the expected depth, it computes the expected numbers, and
it computes what the Lean definition computes (on chains built by translated programs,
and on written-out chains).  Every depth also has programs of two and three arguments,
before and after the chain.
