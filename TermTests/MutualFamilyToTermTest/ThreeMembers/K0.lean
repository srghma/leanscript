/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 0` on three members: programs that read 1 link down

Part of the three-member family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/ThreeMembers/Common.lean` for the families and for what
is checked.  At depth `0` a branch reads only the answer at the link right below it: sums
with one, two and three arguments, and a fold of `M1`/`M2`/`M3`, whose members have
three different shapes.
The last section checks that a `match` that does not recurse is a `casesOn`, not a fold. -/

wildcard) of the member at that level. -/
