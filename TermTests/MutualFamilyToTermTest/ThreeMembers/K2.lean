/-! # `mutualRecursiveFamily_rec 2` on three members: programs that read 3 links down

Part of the three-member family tests; see
`TermTests/MutualFamilyToTermTest/ThreeMembers/Common.lean` for the family and for what is
checked.  The programs are the tribonacci recursion of `TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` on
the number of links, written as three mutual functions: the branch of a link reads the
answers at the next 3 links, which go round the members `X → Y → Z → X`, so it looks
2 times, each time into a subvalue of the next member.  Each program comes in five
forms: with one argument (the chain), and with two and three arguments before and after
the chain. -/
