/-! Part of the `array_rec k` translation tests; see
`TermTests/ArrayRecToTermTest/Common.lean` for what is checked.

## Reading past the head, and skipping a level

An array has one subvalue at each step, its tail, so there is no "both subtrees" for a
fold of an array to reach: the window of `array_rec k` already holds the answers at all
the `k + 1` nearest suffixes.  The analogue of reading *into* a subvalue is reading the
elements after the head: at depth `k` the branch at `x :: y₁ :: … :: yₖ :: rest` may read
`y₁ … yₖ`, which the translation takes off the tail (the array the branch binds) by
nested `array_casesOn`s.  The tail has at least `k` elements there, so their empty cases
are never taken. -/
