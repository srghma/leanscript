/-! # A `mutual` block whose members also occur nested

```lean
mutual
  inductive P where
    | leaf (n : Nat)
    | node (q : Option Q)
  inductive Q where
    | mk (a : P) (b : P)
end
```

`Q` occurs in `P` *inside* `Option`.  Lean folds this block with **three** motives — `P`,
`Q` and the auxiliary type `Option Q` — so `deriving LeanScriptTyWf` now hoists `Option Q`
into a third member of the family (`LeanScript.Deriving.hoistAux`), in the order of the
recursor's motives, and gives `Option Q` an instance selecting that member.  The family is
then the one the recursor folds, and a structural recursion on it is
`mutualRecursiveFamily_rec k` (`LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecFamily`).

The same happens for a structure around a member (`Nat × B`), and for a single declaration
that is a family because it recurses through `List` and that also holds an `Option` of
itself.  A lone declaration with only non-recursive wrappers around itself (`Cell | mk Nat
(Option Cell)`) keeps its old tree, a recursive record. -/
