/-! # Function and delayed fields in a fold deeper than `0`

`TermTests/StructRecTest/NestedOther.lean` folds declarations with a field that is a
function into the declaration (`node (f : Nat → FT)`) or a delay of it (`Thunk TS`), but
only by the depth-`0` fold.  At depth `k` the window holds, at such a field, the function
of the **answer trees** (`Nat ⇒ ⟨answer, window⟩`) or the delayed answer tree, and the
translation binds beside it the function of the answers (`fun a => (window a).1`) or the
delayed answer (`Thunk.mk (window.get).1`), which the branch reads as it reads the
depth-`0` window.

So a recursion that reads further down elsewhere — through a direct field, an `Option`, …
— may now also read the answers at `f a` or at a delayed value, at any level it reaches:
the top level (where the window is `j = k` levels deep), inside a subvalue taken apart
(`j = k - 1`, …), or at the frontier (`j = 0`).

What stays out of reach is taking apart `f a` itself: Lean's structural recursion does
not accept `match f 0 with …` followed by a recursive call on what the match binds, so
no such program reaches the translation.

For each program the kernel checks (`kernel_rfl`) the depth of the fold, the value on a
sample input as a fixed number, and the value against the Lean definition.  The terms bound
beside the window are `Term.fnTreeAnswer` and `Term.thunkTreeAnswer`: that they give the
depth-`0` window, at every depth and in every environment, is proved in
`LeanScript/RecFnFieldFacts.lean`, and the checks below confirm that the translation
writes them. -/
