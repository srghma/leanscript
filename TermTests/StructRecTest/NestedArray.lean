/-! # Nested inductives through `Array`

```lean
inductive ATree where
  | node (v : Nat) (kids : Array ATree)
```

has the tree `Ty.recObject ⟨nat, array self⟩` (checked below): `Array`'s model is a shape of
the language, so the occurrence stands inside it.  Lean accepts a structural recursion on
it written as a `mutual` block over `ATree`, `Array ATree` and `List ATree`, which it
compiles into `ATree.brecOn` with three motives.

Such a recursion is now `recObject_rec k` (`LeanScript.ToTerm.TransRecObject`): the window
of the fold holds, at the field `kids`, the **array of the answers** at the children, and the
answer of the helper on `Array ATree` is computed from it — the helper on `List ATree` is the
fold of that array (`array_rec`), its branch given the answer at the head and the answer at
the rest, and the helper on `Array ATree` is then applied to the answer at its list.  Both
are bound with `letE` before the branch of `ATree.node` reads them.

The helpers may answer types other than the main function (`ATree.labels` answers a
`List Nat`), and a recursive newtype over an array (`Rose | mk (kids : Array Rose)`) is
folded the same way, as `recAlias_rec k`.  A helper that takes a child apart rather than
reading its answer has no term: the children themselves are not in the window. -/
