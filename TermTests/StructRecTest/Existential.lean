/-! # Structures with an **existentially quantified type field**

```lean
structure Unfold (α : Type) where
  State      : Type
  seed       : State
  step       : State → Option (State × α)
  measure    : State → Nat
  decreasing : ∀ x x' a, step x = some (x', a) → measure x' < measure x
```

hides the type of its state: two values of `Unfold Nat` may choose different `State`s, so
`Unfold Nat` has no one tree of the language and no `LeanScriptTyWf` instance.  It is
translated anyway (`LeanScript.ToTerm.ExistentialArgs`):

* **a value** of it is built by the constructor function of `#leanscript_ctor`, whose type
  is the layout `Unfold.mk.leanScriptLayout α State` at the `State` the value chose (the
  proof `decreasing` is erased, as every proof is);
* **a call on a value that is written out** (`countdown.take n`, `(countFrom k).take n`)
  is specialized to that value: the value is substituted, so its `State`, `seed` and `step`
  are known, and the call is an ordinary term — here, the `nat_rec` of `Unfold.take.go`.
  This holds for any function on it, `@[inline]` or not (`firstOut`), since a function of
  a type without a tree cannot be declared in the signature;
* **a function of such a value** (`Unfold.take`, `firstOut`, `Pipe.run`, …) translates to a
  term **for every choice of the hidden type**: a Lean function
  `fun (State : TyWf) => (… : Term Sg Γ (Unfold.mk.leanScriptLayout α State ⇒ …))`, which
  is what a function out of an existential is.  Given the tree a value chose, it is a term
  that can be applied to that value; the tree is found by unification (`take_term _`).

Covered below: `Unfold` with a state of `Nat`, of a pair and of a list; a structure with
two hidden types (`Pipe`); a structure whose recursion answers a value of the hidden type
(`Boxed.iter`); two existential arguments at once; and a function that builds a new value of
the existential structure (`Boxed.bump`).  Each is checked by running the term, against fixed
numbers and against the Lean definition. -/
