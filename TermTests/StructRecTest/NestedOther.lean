/-! # Nested inductives through other type formers

`TermTests/StructRecTest/NestedArray.lean` folds a declaration of **one** constructor
whose occurrences sit directly in an `Array`.  This file covers the rest of what a nested
occurrence can sit in, apart from `List` (`TermTests/ShapesTest/Nested.lean`):

* **Several constructors** (`inductive UTree | leaf | node (v : Nat) (kids : Array UTree)`,
  a JSON-like type, and also `Option T` or a structure inside a constructor).  The fold of
  a recursive tagged union hands over an answer only at a field that *is* the union, so
  `deriving LeanScriptTyWf` gives such a declaration the tree of a **recursive newtype
  whose body is the union of its constructors**, `Ty.recAlias (Ty.taggedUnion …)`, whose
  fold hands over an answer wherever an occurrence sits.  A constructor is `recAlias_mk`
  around `taggedUnion_mk`, a `match` is `recAlias_casesOn` around `taggedUnion_casesOn`,
  and a structural recursion is `recAlias_rec k`.
* **An array of anything that holds the declaration**: `Array (Array T)`,
  `Array (Option T)`, `Array (String × T)`.  The window holds the array of the elements'
  windows, and each one is taken apart as its type says when the helper on
  `List (Array T)`, `List (Option T)`, … is folded over it (`array_rec`).
* **A function into the declaration** (`node (f : Nat → FnTree)`): the window is the
  function of the answers, so the answer at `f a` is the window applied to `a`.
* **A delay** (`Thunk T`): the window is the delayed answer.
* **A container of one's own** with a `LeanScriptTyWf` instance (`MyList T`), which,
  like `List`, becomes a member of a family.

Still refused: an array inside a *family* — `List (Array T)`, `Array (List T)`, or an
array of another member of a `mutual` block — because the fold of a family hands over an
answer only at a field that *is* a member (checked at the end). -/
