/-! # More `mutual` blocks whose members also occur nested

Companion to `TermTests/StructRecTest/MutualNested.lean`, which has the basic case
(`Option Q` inside `P`).  This file covers further shapes of the same kind:

* occurrences in **both directions** (`Option Q` inside `P`, `Option P` inside `Q`);
* a member under **`List`** (`List Q` inside `P`), which becomes a recursive member of the
  family (`nil | cons Q (List Q)`);
* **several wrappers** and a nested occurrence of the member itself
  (`Option (Option Q)` and `Option P` inside `P`), each a member of its own;
* a **type parameter** (`P α`, `Q α`);
* a **user structure** and a **product** around members, in a **three-member** block
  mixing `Option` and `List`.

and several kinds of function on them: sums started at any member (including the
auxiliary type `Option (Option Q)`), non-recursive `match`es, a **map** that rebuilds the
value (its members answer `P2` and `Q2`, types with no `Inhabited` instance: the
translation builds the defaults it needs from their constructors,
`LeanScript.ToTerm.synthDefault?`), members answering different types, an accumulator, and
a recursion that reads two levels down.

Every translated function is run by the kernel (`kernel_rfl`) and compared with the Lean
function. -/
