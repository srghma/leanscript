# The `fib` suite, over arrays: `array_rec` written out at every depth

`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` takes the family of Fibonacci programs — the `n + 2`
recursion, the tail-recursive loop, the pair recursion, the `for` loop, and the
tribonacci … hexanacci numbers — and writes each of them as a term of the grammar.  This
file is the same exercise for a recursion over an **array**, which is what
`LeanScript.Term.array_rec k` is for.

The array-valued `fib` is the **continuant**:

```lean
def cont : List Nat → Nat
  | [] => 1
  | [a] => a
  | a :: b :: as => a * cont (b :: as) + cont as
```

It is `fib` with a coefficient at each step — on a list of `n` ones it **is** `fib (n + 1)`
(`cont_replicate_one`) — and, exactly like `fib`'s `n + 2` pattern, it reads the answer at
a suffix that is not the immediate tail.  That is the recursion the depth is for: at
`k = 1` the branch of `array_rec` is given the answers at `as` and at `as.drop 1`.

What is written out here, in the grammar and with the value of every term proved at
**every** list rather than at a few:

| the program | the node it is | here |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `cont` (reads the tail of the tail) | `array_rec 1` | `contTerm_eval` |
| `cont3`, `cont4` (three and four suffixes) | `array_rec 2`, `array_rec 3` | `cont3Term_eval`, `cont4Term_eval` |
| `contTR` (tail-recursive, two accumulators) | `array_rec 0` **at a function type** | `contTRTerm_eval` |
| `contPair` (pair recursion) | `array_rec 0` at a record type | `contPairTerm_eval` |
| `contLoop` (`for x in l do …`) | the same fold, written as a loop | `contLoop_eq` |
| a recursion that **halves** the list | no depth reaches it | prose at the end |

Every program runs in one signature, `sigArith`, whose two declarations are `add` and
`mul`: arithmetic is external to the language.

Every term here is the Lean program **translated** by `#leanscript_to_term`, which reads
a structurally recursive function on `List Nat` applied to `a.toList` as `array_rec k` on
`a` (`TermTests/ArrayRecToTermTest/Common.lean`).  The bases and the branch the proofs
name are read back out of the translated term with `#leanscript_fold_bases` and
`#leanscript_fold_branch`, and an `example` beside each pins the term it is.  What is
checked on top is the value of each term, at **every** argument.

```lean
def contTR : List Nat → Nat → Nat → Nat
  | [], a, _ => a
  | x :: xs, a, b => contTR xs (x * a + b) a
```

This is the array-valued `fibLoopTR`: it walks the list from the **front**, carrying the
two continuants of the prefix read so far.  It descends one element at a time, so it is
the fold at the **default** depth — but its value is not a number, it is the function of
the two accumulators.  `array_rec` folds at any type, function types included. -/

Desugared, this is `ForIn.forIn l (1, 0) …` in the identity monad: a fold over the list
whose state is the pair of mutable variables — that is, §3 and §4 written with different

/-! ## 6. What no depth reaches

The one program of the `fib` family that is refused is `fibFast`, whose recursive call is
at `n / 2`.  Its array analogue is a recursion that **halves the list**:

```lean
def contFast : List Nat → Nat
  | [] => 1
  | l => … contFast (l.take (l.length / 2)) … contFast (l.drop (l.length / 2)) …
```

A depth is a fixed number of *elements* to descend by, and the window the evaluator
carries holds the answers at the `k + 1` immediate suffixes.  A call at a list that is
half as long is not a call at a suffix at all, so no `k` reaches it, exactly as no depth
of `nat_rec` reaches `n / 2`.  That is a limit of the folds, not of the depth: it needs a
recursion justified by a measure, which this grammar deliberately does not have.
