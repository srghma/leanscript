# The `fib` suite, over a recursive record: `recObject_rec` at every depth

`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` writes the family of Fibonacci programs — the `n + 2`
recursion, the tail-recursive loop, the pair recursion, and the tribonacci … hexanacci
numbers — as terms that fold over a `Nat`; `TermTests/ArrayRecDepthTest.lean` does the same
for a fold over an array and `TermTests/RecUnionRecDepthTest.lean` for a fold over a
recursive tagged union.  This file is that exercise for a fold over a **recursive
record**, which is `LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec`.

## Why a record needed a different window

A recursive record is the one binder that can never have a field that is *literally* an
occurrence of itself: a record has values only when **all** of its fields do, so a field
written `Ty.self` would leave it with none and the tree would not be a type
(`LeanScript.Ty.not_wf_recObject_self`).  So `LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders`, which puts the
value of the fold after a field that *is* an occurrence, put nothing anywhere: the fold of
a record handed its branch no answer at all
(`LeanScript.TyWf.recBinders_recObject`, and the `rfl` example in §1).

What the fold hands the branch now is one **window** binder: the record's own fields with
every occurrence of the record replaced by the answer there
(`LeanScript.TyWf.recObjectMap`), and at depth `k` by the **answer tree** of depth `k` at
that subvalue — the answer at it beside, in the shape of *its* fields, the depth-`k - 1`
trees of its own subvalues (`LeanScript.TyWf.recObjectAnswerTree`).  So a depth-`k` branch
reads the answers at everything `k + 1` levels down, along the path it descends, exactly
as a depth-`k` branch of `Term.recTaggedUnion_rec` does.

## The record

```lean
inductive Cell where
  | mk (label : Nat) (next : Option Cell)
```

a chain of labelled cells — the shortest recursive record there is, since the occurrence
has to sit inside something that has a value without it, here an `Option`.  Its `fib` is
the program the depth is for:

```lean
def Cell.fib : Cell → Nat
  | .mk _ none => 0
  | .mk _ (some (.mk _ none)) => 1
  | .mk _ (some (.mk l (some g))) => fib (.mk l (some g)) + fib g
```

| the program | the node it is | here |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Cell.fib` (reads two cells down) | `recObject_rec 1` | `fibTerm` |
| `Cell.trib`, `Cell.tetra`, `Cell.penta`, `Cell.hexa` | `recObject_rec 2 … 5` | `tribTerm`, … |
| `Cell.fibLoopTR` (tail-recursive, two accumulators) | `recObject_rec 0` **at a function type** | `fibTRTerm` |
| `Cell.fibPair` (pair recursion) | `recObject_rec 0` at a record type | `fibPairTerm` |
| `Cell.cont` (the continuant, which reads the **label** too) | `recObject_rec 1` | `contTerm` |
| `fibFast` (halves its argument) | no depth reaches it | the prose at the end |

**What is checked.**  Each definition below states the type of the term it builds, so the
file fails to build if the branch a program needs cannot be written at that depth, or is
written in a context other than the documented one; what the contexts are is pinned
separately, by the `rfl` examples of §1.  And `LeanScript.Ty.Den` gives a recursive record
its values — the W-tree of its fields — so the terms also **run**: §7 of
`TermTests.RecObjectRecDepthTest` builds chains with the introduction form and checks,
with the kernel, that every term answers what its Lean reference does.

The Lean programs the terms transcribe are checked too, in §0: their values at `10` by
`#guard`, that `Cell.fib` is the ordinary `fib` of the chain's length, and the request's
own theorems — that the pair recursion carries `(fib n, fib (n + 1))`, that its first
component is `fib`, and that the tail-recursive loop computes `fib`.
