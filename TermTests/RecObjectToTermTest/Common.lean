# `recObject_rec k`, produced by `#leanscript_to_term` from Lean programs

`TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/` tests `LeanScript.Term.nat_rec k` by translating `fib`,
`tribonacci`, `tetranacci`, `pentanacci`, … and `TermTests/ArrayRecToTermTest/` does the
same for `LeanScript.Term.array_rec k`.  These files do it for
`LeanScript.Term.recObject_rec k`, the fold of a **recursive record** that reads `k + 1`
levels at a time.

**Which Lean program is a `recObject_rec`.**  A recursive record is an inductive type with
**one** constructor that mentions itself only *inside* another type — it has to, or it
would have no values.  The shortest one is a chain of labelled cells:

```lean
inductive Cell where
  | mk (label : Nat) (next : Option Cell)
  deriving LeanScriptTyWf
```

whose tree is `Ty.recObject ⟨nat, Option self⟩` (checked below).  Lean compiles an
ordinary structural recursion on it — pattern matching on `.mk a none` and
`.mk a (some c)`, calling itself on the cells below — into `Cell.brecOn` (Lean's
structural recursion on a nested inductive), and the translation reads that as
`recObject_rec k`.  The programs are written as ordinary Lean, with no `decreasing_by`
and nothing added for the translation.

The depth `k` is read off the compiled recursion: it is the smallest `k` for which every
branch reads only the labels and the values of the recursion at the cells at most
`k + 1` levels down, which is what the **window** of `recObject_rec k` holds
(`LeanScript.TyWf.recObjectRecBinders`).  So `Cell.sum` (reads the value one cell down)
is `k = 0`, `Cell.fib` (two cells down) is `k = 1`, the tribonacci numbers `k = 2`, and
so on.

The inputs are built by translated Lean programs too: `Cell.ofNat n` (a chain of `n + 1`
cells, a `nat_rec` whose branch builds a cell with `recObject_mk`) and `Cell.ofList a l`
(a chain labelled `a :: l`, a fold of a list).

Each program (one file per depth, so that they build in parallel) is checked:

* the translated term **is** a `recObject_rec` of the expected depth (`…_depth`);
* the term computes the expected numbers;
* the term computes what the Lean definition computes.

The equations are checked by `kernel_rfl` rather than `rfl`: the elaborator's own check
of such an equation runs out of heartbeats (every extern call goes through the case
splits of `Extern.eval`), while the kernel checks it quickly (see
`LeanScript/KernelRfl.lean`).  `kernel_rfl` is still a proof by `Eq.refl`, checked by the
kernel.
