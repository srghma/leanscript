# `recObject_rec k` on a **binary** recursive record

`TermTests/RecObjectToTermTest/` folds `Cell`, a record that holds *one* `Option` of
itself.  These files fold a record that holds *two*:

```lean
inductive BNode where
  | mk (label : Nat) (left right : Option BNode)
```

— a binary tree whose every node carries a label and has zero, one or two children.  Its
tree is `Ty.recObject ⟨nat, Option self, Option self⟩` (checked below), so each branch of
`recObject_rec k` receives the answers at *both* children, and the window of depth `k`
reaches `k + 1` levels down along every path.

One file per depth, `K0.lean` … `K2.lean`, checked as in
`TermTests/RecObjectToTermTest/Common.lean`: the translated term is a `recObject_rec` of
the expected depth, computes the expected numbers, and computes what the Lean definition
computes.
