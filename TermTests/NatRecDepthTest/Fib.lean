/-! ## The same definitions, translated

`#leanscript_to_term` reads the depth off the compiled recursion: it is the smallest
number of steps at which the history the `brecOn` hands the branch is fully read. -/

/-- `fib` as the request writes it. -/
def fibDef : Nat → Nat
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | n + 2 => fibDef n + fibDef (n + 1)

def fibDef_term : Term sigAdd [] (TyWf.prim .nat ⇒ TyWf.prim .nat) :=
  #leanscript_to_term fibDef

example : runAdd fibDef_term 0 = 0 := by kernel_rfl
example : runAdd fibDef_term 1 = 1 := by kernel_rfl
example : runAdd fibDef_term 12 = fibDef 12 := by kernel_rfl

/-! ## What is still refused

`fibFast` calls itself at `n / 2`.  That is not a descent by a fixed number of steps, so
no depth makes it a fold of this kind; Lean compiles it by well-founded recursion, which
the translation refuses. -/

    let d := a * a + b * b
