/-! Part of the `nat_rec k` translation tests; see `TermTests/NatRecDepthTest/Common.lean`
for what is checked.

## Skipping levels

A natural number has one subvalue at each step, its predecessor, so there is no "both
subtrees" for a fold of a `Nat` to reach: the window of `nat_rec k` already holds the
answers at **all** of the `k + 1` predecessors, so a recursion that reads only some of
them — the answer two or three steps down, and not the ones in between — is a `nat_rec k`
of the depth of the furthest one it reads. -/
